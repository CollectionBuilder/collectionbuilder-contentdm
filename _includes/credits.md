[CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) is family of open source tools for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology. CollectionBuilder is a project of University of Idaho Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and the University's [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL)](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/). It was built following the [Lib-STATIC](https://lib-static.github.io) methodology. 

This site is built using [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm) which utilizes [CONTENTdm](https://www.oclc.org/en/contentdm.html) APIs to create an engaging "skin" on top of an existing digital collection repository.

### Software and Tools Used

Powered by the open source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modern static web stack, it puts collection metadata to work building beautiful sites.

The basic frame work is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

Metadata visualizations are built using open source libraries such as [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/), [lightGallery](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/), [TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/), [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/), [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes), and [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/).

Object metadata is exposed using [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) standards.
