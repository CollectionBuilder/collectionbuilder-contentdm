This site is built using [CollectionBuilder-CDM](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/) which utilizes [CONTENTdm](https://www.oclc.org/en/contentdm.html) API's to create an engaging "skin" on top of an existing digital collection repository.
[CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/) is an open source tool for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology.

CollectionBuilder is a project of University of Idaho Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) as part of the Lib-STATIC toolkit. 
Powered by the open source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modern static web stack, it puts collection metadata to work building beautiful sites.

The basic frame work is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).
Metadata visualizations are built using open source libraries such as [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/), [lightGallery](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/), [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/), [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes), and [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/).
Object metadata is exposed using [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) standards.
