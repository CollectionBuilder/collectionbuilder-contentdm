Opened in 1894 and operated by the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, the wharf stretched a record-breaking 4,600 feet (nearly a mile) out into the bay and featured a double-tracked railroad line. However, by 1897, San Pedro had emerged as the site of Los Angeles harbor, and shipping closed at the Long Wharf by 1913. It was dismantled by 1920. It stood just north of Santa Monica Canyon at present-day Will Rogers State Beach. Printed on reverse: This photograph shows the view down Santa Monica Canyon to the ocean and the Long Wharf. The buildings are the early bathhouses and stores that served the tourists who came from Santa Monica and Los Angeles to enjoy the beach. The mesa on the right became the Huntington Palisades.
