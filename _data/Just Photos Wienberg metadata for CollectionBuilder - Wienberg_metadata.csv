This photo was taken in 1953 around the time that Polos changed the name of the restaurant to The Sea Lion Inn. The establishment went through several renovations on this spot over the ensuing decades--due to either expansion or fire. In 1996, this site opened as Duke's Malibu restaurant.

Car parked near Inceville church,"A car is parked at the Inceville location with the church in the background. Inceville was a pioneering movie studio built by film producer Thomas Ince on a ranch located at present-day Sunset Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway in Pacific Palisades, California. The church seen here was part of the expansive network of sets. Ince ran the studio for several years, starting in 1912, before selling Inceville and moving on. The village eventually burned to the ground in 1922; only the church, made of stone, survived. For a period in the 1920s, it was known as the Tea Room. It would later disappear as well. The date on this print suggests that the photo was taken after the fire.

Opened in 1894 and operated by the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, the wharf stretched a record-breaking 4,600 feet (nearly a mile) out into the bay and featured a double-tracked railroad line. However, by 1897, San Pedro had emerged as the site of Los Angeles harbor, and shipping closed at the Long Wharf by 1913. It was dismantled by 1920. It stood just north of Santa Monica Canyon at present-day Will Rogers State Beach. Printed on reverse: This photograph shows the view down Santa Monica Canyon to the ocean and the Long Wharf. The buildings are the early bathhouses and stores that served the tourists who came from Santa Monica and Los Angeles to enjoy the beach. The mesa on the right became the Huntington Palisades.

match01514,"View of the Long Wharf (or Mammoth Wharf) of Santa Monica, which was intended to be the primary shipping port for the Los Angeles area. Opened in 1894 and operated by the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, the wharf stretched a record-breaking 4,600 feet (nearly a mile) out into the bay and featured a double-tracked railroad line. However, by 1897, San Pedro had emerged as the site of Los Angeles harbor, and shipping closed at the Long Wharf by 1913. It was dismantled by 1920. It stood just north of Santa Monica Canyon at present-day Will Rogers State Beach. Printed on reverse: This photograph shows the view down Santa Monica Canyon to the ocean and the Long Wharf. The buildings are the early bathhouses and stores that served the tourists who came from Santa Monica and Los Angeles to enjoy the beach. The mesa on the right became the Huntington Palisades.

Malibu 14,"Thelma Todd's Sidewalk Cafe, also marketed as Thelma Todd's Inn, occupied a distinctive Spanish-style building on the Pacific Coast Highway, just west of Sunset Boulevard. Built in 1928, the property was acquired by the film actress Thelma Todd and converted to a cafe in 1934. Her mysterious death in her garage above the Cafe a year later shocked and intrigued the public. After her death, the Cafe continued operating under her name for some years afterward. Thelma Todd's also highlighted its restaurant variously as Joya's Cuisine Unequaled or Steaks of Joya's Unequaled.
