Collation of 69 folia assembled in quires of 8, with 7 parchment quires flanked by 2 paper quires. Quires 1 and 9 both have only 7 folia; we surmise that the first folio of quire 1 and last folio of quire 9 were used as pastedowns. Quires 2-3 and 5-8 have quire signatures in red Roman capital letters at the bottom right of the recto of the first folio of the quire; with minor variation, the first half of A (2) and B (3) are labeled with lowercase Roman numerals (Ai, Aii, Aiii, Aiv), while the first half of quires 5-8 are labeled with Arabic numerals (C.1, C.2, C.3, C.4). Quire 4 has no quire signatures at all. Quire 5 has only 7 folia, with the sixth folio (between ff. 35-36 as labeled) having been cut out. Nineteenth-century pencil foliation at upper right throughout (labeled ff. 1-59) does not count blank folia: 1 folio btw ff. 22-23; 4 folia in quire 8 after f. 57; and 5 folia at the beginning of quire 9 btw ff. 57-58.

Inside the book are 59 marked folios and 10 unmarked folios. The text is written in a single column of twenty lines in brown ink and there are initial capitals and rubrics written in red. There are 35 decorated initials. They range from 1-3 colors used which vary between red, blue, yellow, black, green, and orange.
