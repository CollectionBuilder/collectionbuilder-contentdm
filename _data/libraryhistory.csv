Proctorville Library,,"Ecklar, Marie McRae.",,1945-03,,Public libraries--North Carolina;,"Proctorville, Robeson County, North Carolina, United States",,(1929-1945) Depression and World War Two,"The library structure was originally a hot dog stand operated by Harry Lewis. Lewis’s grandfather, W.R. Surles, owned the land and structure, which he provided for use as a library in the late 1930s. On account of the small size of the structure, only one person (or two if small children) could use the library at a time. Children would wait in line for their turn in the library. According to an article in the Dec. 23, 1939, issue of The State Magazine, the citizens of Proctorville started up the library with donations from the community, initially acquiring a collection of 400 books. The author contends that “Proctorville is the smallest town in the United States which possesses a full time public librarian, which it does with the aid of the P.W.A.” (P.W.A. may possibly stand for Public Works Administration or be a typo of W.P.A) The librarian’s name was evelyn Singletary Clyburn. The P.W.A. (or possibly WPA?) ceased to provide support circa 1941, and since that time the library has been maintained and operated by volunteers from the Proctorville Book Club. A more permanent brick structure replaced the former hot dog stand during the 1950s. This current library building is named the “W.R. Surles Memorial Library,” as Surles bequeathed money to build the structure. It's open on Thursday afternoons.",,,,,,"Copyrighted Material see http://digital.ncdcr.gov/u?/p249901coll22,63752",,,,State Archives of North Carolina,,Image,English,Negatives (photographic),496.05 KB,,Transforming the Tar Heel State: The Legacy of Public Libraries in North Carolina,image/tiff;,,,,All,State Library of North Carolina,"Cumber, Kim",,tts_Archives_003.tif,\Preservation_content\tts\images_master\,,2008-09,"Cumber, Kim",,600 dpi,24,,,D.2008.4.079,,433608815,2008-09-25,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/104,104,105.jp2,Volume12\tts_Archives_003.tif,/p249901coll36/image/105.jp2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The opening of the new library on January 17, 1940, precipitated a dramatic expansion of services. Indeed, the early forties were banner years as far as the Stanford L. Warren Public Library (so named in honor of its primary benefactor) was concerned. The new library contained a children's room, and librarian Selena Wheeler initiated a Saturday morning story hour in 1940, which proved so effective and popular that the library sponsored a Storytelling Institute the next year. On Wheeler's advice, the library also designated its collection of books on and by African Americans as a noncirculating, special collection during this period. The library made special arrangements with local book sellers to purchase books by African-American authors at a reduced price. In 1942, Wheeler convinced the Board to use the Hattie B. Wooten Browsing Room to house the collection and subsequently did much to expand and classify the collection. Over time, with the addition of many rare and out-of-print books, the collection became one of the best of its kind in the state.",,,,,,"Copyrighted Material see http://digital.ncdcr.gov/u?/p249901coll22,63752",,,,Durham County Library,,Image,English,Photographs,670.414 KB,,Transforming the Tar Heel State: The Legacy of Public Libraries in North Carolina,image/tiff;,,,,All,State Library of North Carolina,"Richardson, Lynn",,tts_DurhCoun_3.tif,\Preservation_content\tts\images_master\,,2008-08,"Richardson, Lynn",,600 dpi,24,,,,,433605709,2008-09-25,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/129,129,130.jp2,,/p249901coll36/image/130.jp2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This marked the beginning of the Iredell  County Library which operated separate from the Statesville Public Library. The  Iredell County Library operated as a bookmobile operation exclusively until the  fall of 1954.  The first bookmobile was a converted school bus acquired by the Iredell County  Board of Education mainly to supplement the County school libraries. T. Ward  Guy, the Superintendent of the Iredell County Schools at the time is credited  with obtaining this first.

In 1938 the depository was moved to larger quarters on the  second floor of the Welfare Building, Court House Square, Statesville. In 1940,  State Aid was granted so that library- owned books could be purchased. In that  same year, a Chevrolet panel truck was purchased for bookmobile service. This  unit had a revolving wheel on the inside. In 1941 the depository was moved for a  third time to the basement of the Iredell County Court House and shared space  with the Clerk of Court’s storage quarters. In June of 1942 records indicated a  total of 2,246 books owned by the library with a circulation of 40,509.  The WPA was discontinued and Mrs. Katherine Stitt, a professional librarian  assumed her duties on a part- time basis on July 1st. Her salary was provided by  State Aid.

The  earliest reports of a library operating in Iredell come from the writings of  historians and newspapers. Dr. P. F.

For this last purpose there was an association with a  library, kept at the house of J. P. McRee, where the books were distributed every  three months. The association was dissolved in 1825 and the books were sold  out. The records of the association are in existence at the house of James S.  Byers during his life but being considered of no value or interest they were  destroyed. There was a similar association in Thya Congregation.""  January 6, 1882 -- The Landmark reports that the members of the Young Men's  Christian Association ( YMCA) have conceived the idea of re- establishing the  public library and desire to collect up the now scattered books of the old library.

In 1934, Mrs. Andrew Jamieson, chairman of the Literary Department  of the Oxford Woman's Club, "" an office which she took with avowed purpose of  establishing a free library,"" led a drive to establish a town and county tax for the  support of a public library. On November 6, 1936, the Raleigh News and  Observer reported, "" Granville County has won for North Carolina the distinction  of having been the first county in all the southeastern states to levy a county tax  for county- wide library services."" The county is proud of this fact and the  continued support for public library facilities.  Special Collections  Richard H. Thornton Library has a genealogy collection which is notable  considering the size of the library. Early on, during Mrs. Cannady's leadership,  genealogical materials were collected and a North Carolina Room began.  Directors since that time and patrons have promoted the existing collection and  supported enlarging it as funds were available. Since many settlers passed  through Granville County to points south and west, and because Granville was  formed in 1746, many records and much history exist. Several collections are  housed within the collection, the largest being the scrapbook collection of  Francis B. Hays. It is notable in size and information.

It was reported in the newspaper that 4,114 books circulated  through the bookmobile during the three weeks the truck made its route. The  second bookmobile was provided for Rowan Public Library by the Works  Progress Administration ( WPA) in June, July and August of 1940. The WPA also  furnished the workers for the truck as well as 3,000 books. It was an extremely  successful venture, so much so that the Rowan County Commission was  prepared to purchase a bookmobile. It was ordered in 1941, the first of  December. The attack on Pearl Harbor happened a few days later and the U. S.  entered the war. The bookmobile was put on hold due to the war, but in 1947 it  was expected to arrive. A green Chevrolet panel truck, specifically modified for  use as a bookmobile, finally arrived in April of 1948.

From 1937-  1943, the librarian for the newly opened Negro branch of Rowan Public Library  was funded by WPA monies. The WPA also funded two assistants to the main  library, and a book- mending workshop in 1936- 1937. The workshop was hosted  in Salisbury for Rowan, Iredell, Alexander, Davie and Yadkin county libraries and  schools. This program was supervised primarily by Dorothy Kizziah under Julia  G. Eagan. Thirty- four women mended and cleaned 21,067 books for circulation.  The women who attended these workshops made money that helped them  feed their children during this difficult time. For a three month period in 1940,  the WPA also furnished a bookmobile, staff and 3,000 books to serve the rural  areas of Rowan County through the Rowan Public Library.  Notable Stories  John Hart, author and local resident of Rowan, wrote his first novel, "" King of  Lies"", published in 2006, at the library.  Jo White Linn, noted genealogist and author, did much of her research in the  Edith M. Clark History Room and at her death in 2006 donated her research files  and her many genealogical books to the History Room.  The library is built on land that has had a long and interesting history. Colonel  Adlai Osborne, an early Clerk of Rowan Court bought the land in 1773, dug a  well on the property which still exists and kept records from the court. He later  sold the land to his good friend Judge Spruce McKay, who maintained his law  office on this land. There he taught such notable attorneys as William R. Davie  and Andrew Jackson. He sold this land to his brother- in- law Archibald  Henderson who found the law office too small for his needs and built a larger  one on the corner of Church and Fisher where it stands today on the library  property. The Henderson Law office housed the first public library of Rowan",2008-10,"Allen, Christy",,,,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/764,764,765.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/765.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

McKay’s early law office was sold by Henderson’s grandson A. H.  Boyden in 1876, dismantled and sent to Philadelphia for the exposition, but was  never seen again. A. H. Boyden’s grandson Burton Craige and his heirs donated  the lot in 1949 for the purpose of establishing a library, along with $ 75,000 to aid  in the construction of the building. The old Boyden home place was demolished  in 1949 and the new library building was completed in 1951. Rowan Public  Library has produced a video series, A Ramble through Rowan, documenting the  history of Rowan County. The lot, on which the library is built, Lot 19 and its rich  history, is the subject of the first film.  Special Collections  Local History/ Genealogy of Rowan County and Western Carolina  The Craige Collection of North Caroliniana including Catesby -- The rare book  room currently houses the Archibald Craige Collection of North Caroliniana, an  amazing collection of books, journals, and pamphlets documenting the history  of North Carolina. Compiled over most of the twentieth century by Burton  Craige and his son, Archibald, the collection contains nearly 2,000 titles, many of  which are rare and include some early imprints by Coupee and Slump, early  printers in Salisbury. Of particular note is the wide array of pamphlets, many  containing speeches of the state’s luminaries. Mr. Craige resided and practiced  law in Virginia, but his family had ties to Rowan County. Archibald Craige  donated the Craige Collection to Rowan Public Library in December of 1999.  The crowning jewel in this collection is The Natural History of Carolina, Florida,  and the Bahama Islands , a two volume set of the flora and fauna of our area  written by English naturalist Mark Catesby in 1753. Catesby ( 1679- 1749) was a  naturalist who traveled in the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and the Bahamas from  1722- 1726.

The Library of Congress  confirmed that the signature was George Washington’s and the speech had  been written by William Jackson, Washington’s secretary. Mr. Oestreicher felt  strongly that the letter be kept in Rowan County and presented it to the library  to be displayed in memory of Colonel A. H. Boyden.

C April, 1949'    A Word from the Officers and Board    has purchased 144 books from this fund.    c~ t of... fides is available at the li-brary.    _    The Sondley Reference Library was a    gift to the city of Asheville by its col­lector,    Dr. Forster A. Sondley. The city    houses it and pays the librarians' salaries.    But there is no provision for funds to    add new books.    Two New Board Members    Two additional members were added    to the Board this year, Mr. Bonsall    Rhodes, Asheville writer, and Mr. Ira    B. Jones, principal of Grace School. A    Membership Is 1369    Membership · in Friends of the Library    has grown tremen~ x.. since the small    group of 12 persOns on die Ii! miry- c: mrr..'    mittee of the American Association of    University Women launched the move­ment    in 1942. Memberships to date    this year have reached 1369. Member­ship    dues are $ 1.00 for adults and $. 50    for children. Friends are very proud of    the number of children who are on the    membership roll.    Books Added To Sondley    During the past year Friends of the    Library made a donation of $ 500.00 to    the Sondley Library. To date Miss Dickey    Between Friendsis a new and- we hope- readable way of presenting    to all of you a report of the year's activities of your organization, Asheville    Friends of the Library.    Your officers and board look at the past year with modest pride and    at the coming one, since by a change in, the Constitution we serve again,    with considerable anticipation.    The program of Friends of the Library is . largely educational- to in-    , form the public of the services and needs of our public libraries. While    many books of great value have been presented to the Sondley, we supply    the only source of actual funds for adding volumes needed to round out    this valuable collection.    During the year the need for a larger library building became a mat­ter    of public discussion. Friends of the library are pleased that this need    is being so widely felt and are delighted that they can begin the new year    with this as the keynote of their program- the . inclusion in Asheville's    long- term community planning of adequate library facilities.    Your officers and board thank you for your membership and your    interest. Friends will succeed when you keep on helping like this.

Officers Serve Two Years    Beginning this year, officers of FrienFis    of the Library will serve for two ye~    instead of one year. This is in accordante    with a change in the Constitution abd    By- Laws effected at the January general    meeting.    Scholarship Fund    A contribution of $ 10.00 was ~ e    in February by Friends of the Librarr    to the Maude Whitson Memorial of the    North Carolina Library Association Schol­arship    Loan Fund.    Two General Meetings    Friends of the Library held two gep­eral    meetings during the past year, one    in October when members and thdir    friends were invited to hear Dr. Geor~ e    Pullen Jackson, author and authority n    religious folk music; and one in Jan­uary    when the public was invited to hear    Mr. George Wright, Asheville attorn) y    and member of the Library Board, on    ,"" State Aid to Public Libraries.""    The ] anuary meeting was held in e    beautiful new Exhibit room which h    recently been completed in the bas­ment    of the Library building.    State Aid    One of the most valuable services that    Friends of the Library can render is to    keep informed on the State Library pr? ­gram,    and to let their legislators, during    legislative years, know of their interest.    A number of individuals did this during    the 1949 session of the General Assent­bly,    and a letter went to key members    from the Friends of the Library Board.!    Magazines for Bookmobile I    Approximately 60,000 magazines were    given to the Bookmobile during the    year by Friends. The service of thb    Bookmobile to oudying communities ~    one of the finest that the Pack Libr,    gives. It is one of 72 Bookmobiles serv­ing    North Carolina.    Christmas Gifts Made    In accordance with its annual custom,    Friends of the Library gave $ 15.00 as    a Christmas gift to the Children's Room    of the Pack Library, and $ 10.00 to the    Children's Room of the Colored library    in December.    Friends Replace Books    Friends of the Library replaced 24    children's books in the Children's Room    of Pack Library, which were destroyed    as a precautionary measure during the    polio epidemic last summer.    Miss Margaret Ligon, librarian, checked    with the Health Department each day,    and books which were in homes re­porting    polio were destroyed without    being returned to the Library.    Friends of the Library made this gift    in honor of the children members of    the organization.    Leaves From The Sondiey    Volume II, Nos. 1 and 2 of Leaves    Prom the Sondley came from the press    this spring. This is one of the most    valuable projects of the Friends in in­forming    the public of the rare material    available in the Sandley Reference Li­brary.    Preparation of the Lea1les, which    is mailed to about 600 recipients, all of    them by request, is a tremendous task    and the committee which has done the    work deserves special praise. Mrs. George    ] emiS() n and Mrs. 1. B. Ordway are co­chairmen    and co- workers with Miss    Dickey on this committee.    Memorial Collection    One of the most interesting projectS    of Friends of the Library is the Memo­rial    Book Collection in the Sandley li­brary.    This is a plan to honor with a    suitable book the memory of citizens    who have died. These memorials are    given by individual friends, 0.( groups,    such as clubs or fraternal organizations.    Ten books were given to this collection    in 1948 through Friends. They may be    seen at the Sandley Library, and Miss    Dickey will be glad to aid anyone in­terested    in contributing to this collection.",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/801,801,802.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/802.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Can Help    An Unusual Act    Some of the Sonclley's extremely valuable books require binding or    special treatment not possible from the regular binding appropriation. A    gift for this need could be made in almost any size.    Southeastern Publications    Because the Sondley has a useful collection of Southeastern material,    the gift of historical or cultural publications- recent or old- will be especial ·    Iy welcome.    Memorial Gifts    The response to using books as a token of remembrance for a friend    or relative who has just died has been so favorable that it is mentioned here    as a fitting memorial. The Sondley Reference Library may be chosen for    such a gift. A memorial bookplate is available.    Your Own Unusual Books    Have you rare or valuable books not often used which need ex ·    pert care? They can be given to the Sondley with the assurance that they    will have the care and treatment they deserve, with the knowledge tl; 1at they    will be available to people of the community for research and study. If you    wish to make a gift of books effective at' a later date we can give you a form    to be placed on the flyleaf of the book indicating the disposition you wish    made of it.    Building Fund    If you have it in mind to make a gift of money to the libraries to­ward    the construction of a new building or for some other purpose, may we    invite you to speak to a member of the library staff or to any of the people    listed below?

Sondley Reference Library Asheville, North Carolina    hEAVES from the SONDL    Volume I    TOWARD A WIDER USEFULNESS    T HIS initial issue of "" Leaves from the Sondley"" commemorates the tenth anniversary of. the    opening of the Sondley Reference Library. Dr. Forster Alexander Sondley was a scholar,    deeply learned in the law, a lover of literature and a discriminating collectOr of books.    Oose to his mind and heart were the people, the history, and the future of his native city. Searching    his mind for a gift that would mean some per- r-------------------....    petual good for its people, Dr. Sondley came to    the conclusion that the best a man can bequeath    is that which has been to him his dearest posses­sion.    His library was unique in that it was his    private accomplishment throughout. He earned    in his profession every dollar spent on the    library. More remarkable still, he had the    scholarship to choose, locate and purchase the    volumes that went into his collection. When    a subject attracted his attention, he undertook    in his collecting to exhaust the available litera­ture    on the theme. The results are many special    collections of inestimable value to scholars.    Happily, this library which was so personal    in its conception and collection is now a public    institution. It has been brought together under    one roof and has been expertly catalogued. It    is, of course, a source of pride and of educa­tional    utility to the people of Asheville. But    the city to which it was presented and which    has accepted the responsibility of maintaining L.._ N_"",_, m_ bl_' I;;...

It is toward    this end that Leaves from the Sondley appears. Its issues will, by degrees, make known to scholars    and students many of the most important collections contained in the Sondley Reference Library.    , ""    .,.

The late Dr. Forster Alexander Sondley, a lawyer and scholar, be­queathed    his private library to the city of Asheville. Many of the books,    letters, and papers, are of unusual value and of interest to librarians, schol­ars,    and research students beyond this area.    The Friends of the Library of Asheville, North Carolina, have under­taken    the task of publishing book lists from time to time to acquaint as    many as possible with the contents of this library. This service is gratis to    any who may be interested. If the book lists are kept and filed, in due    course of time a guide to much of the valuable material in the 33,000    volumes will be available.    These volumes include unique material in the general fields of    History, Indian Ethnology, Archaeology and Linguistics, Biological Sciences,    Religion, Literature, Genealogy, etc., the emphasis being on the Southeastern    States, particularly North Carolina.    In the near future a list of Southern Authors and imprints is to be    compiled.    In view of the current interest in the early graphic arts this first issue    is devoted to examples of early printing from 1480 to 1699.    The Leaves Committee wishes to acknowledge their indebtedness to    Director Charles E. Rush of the Library of the University of North Carolina    for interested advice toward the preparation of this bulletin. For generous    assistance and advice, we also thank Miss Annie Westall, Chairman of the    Asheville Friends of the Library Committee, Miss Philena A. Dickey, Director    of the Sondley Reference Library, Miss Margaret H. Ligon, Head of    Asheville Libraries and Mr. George Myers Stephens of the Stephens Press.

Appreciating the respon­sibility    of residents of a city which has been made the    custodian of an important colledion of books of more    than local significance, these women have felt it their    duty to acquaint scholars and students everywhere with    the scope and quality of the volumes housed here, an    unsuspected treasure, perhaps, where scenery and climate*    have received, justly enough, so much mention.    The Library Committee has enlisted the advice of    experts in evaluating different sections of the library;    has asked Mr. D. Hiden Ramsey, General Manager of    the Asheville Citizen Times, friend of the date Dr. Forster    Alexander Sondley, and observer of the collection during    its different stages of growth, to write an introduction to    their work; and finally has turned. for financial aid to    the Asheville Chamber of Commerce for the printing of    their findings.

The volumes which now comprise the Sondley Ref­erence    Library were originally brought together as a    strictly private library. They were collected not as a    future benefaction but for the personal enjoyment of their    owner. , They are now the property of the City of Ashe­ville    only because life is finite and he could not endure    the thought of the dismemberment of a collection which    h~ had gathered at the expenditure of so much money,    such prodigious effort, and such discriminating scholar­ship.    Dr. Forster Alexander Sondley was an attorney by    pr~ fession. In his prime he was admittedly the ablest    civil lawyer in Western ~ orth Carolina. His professional    attainments brought him distinction and large fees.    But his chief interests were in books. He began as a    young man to collect books. This passion grew with the    years. He seemed to begrudge to the practice of law the    time which he could have spent more pleasantly in the    companionship of books. But if he was to grati. fy his love    of books, he had to have money, much money, and his    workaday profession furnished this money. He lived    frugally but he spent a small fortune on his library. If    he wanted a particular book, he searched the ends of the    earth until he found it and he rarely quibbled over the    cost.    5",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/824,824,825.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/825.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To him books were intended to be read, not    to be displayed. He had little patience with those who    gape in the presence of a large library or who confuse    the simple physical ownership of books with scholarship..    Generally speaking, he purchased only those volumes    which he wished to read or thought he would wish to    read at some indeterminate time in the future. He col­lected    according to the pattern of his versatile scholarship.    It is greatly to be doubted that Dr. Sondley ever · took    the trouble to count or even to estimate the number of    volumes which he owned. His interest always was in    specific books, not in the totality of his library. Every    volume in his collection meant something to him. He    knew where each stood invitingly upon the crowded    shelves. He could have listed most of them from memory.    This writer still carries in his memory the picture of    Dr. Sondley as he last saw him. The collector was then    a feeble old man and time had long since dulled most of    his' interests. But his eyes lighted up pleasantly and his    voice took on warmth as he welcomed a small group of    distinguished scholars who had travelled far to see his    library. Then it was easy to understand what his books    had meant. to him. They had meant virtually everything    - family, comradeship, fame, the very zest of life itself.    Most of the unusual private libraries in the United    States represent the combined efforts of many men. In    the majority of instances, the owner merely furnished the    money and the desire to own while scholars or profes­sional    collectors in his employ did the actual selecting,    6",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/825,825,826.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/826.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dr. Sondley's library was his    private accomplishment throughout. He earned i: Q. his    profession every dollar spent o~ the library. This would    be achievement enough for most men. More remarkable    still, he had the scholarship and found the time from a    busy professional life to choose, locate, and purchase the    volumes that went into his collection.    Of course, Dr. Sondley did not read every book or    pamphlet in his library. Even his amazing intellectual    energies were not equal to such a laborious task. But he    read and digested thousands of the books and pamphlets    and must have been greatly disappointed that life was    not long enough to enable him to read all of them. He    developed rich and accurate scholarshIp in all of the    fields that engaged his interests and determined his    purchases. '    Quantitatively, the library is most impressive. It    includes 32,518 books and pamphlets, not to mention the    hundreds of clippings and letters. Qualitatively, it is    more impressive still. Dr. Sondley did not assemble his    library promiscuously. When a subject attracted his    interest, he undertook in his collecting to exhaust the    available literature on that theme. Of course, he did not    succeed for even this is not possible in the largest and    richest libraries. The results are many special collections    that are of inestimable value to scholars. These collec­tions    are all the more valuable because Dr. Sondley was    so exacting a scholar that he wanted in most instances the    original source material.

In general they encompass the    period from ancient to modem times, with emphasis upon    ancient, medieval, and early modem history. The ancient    period is strongest in Egyptian, Greek, and Roman his­tory,    while the best section on medieval and early modem    times is to be found on England and America. Some    early editions and many reprints of rare'books and manu­scripts,    such as: An Apology for Lollard Doctrines ( at­tributed    to John Wycliffe) works of Goeffrey and Bede,    Returns for the First United States Census, and American    Archives ( 1774- 76), materially enhance the value of this    period of English and American history.    The real value of the library to the history student,    however, is to be found in Dr. Sondley's collection of    books dealing with the southeastern states. This was the    section he knew best and loved most, and a survey of the    books and pamphlets covering this area fills one with ad­miration    for the breadth and discrimination of his selec­tions.    It is difficult to estimate accurately the weight of    the material of this section according to subject or period,    but from a representative list of 425 books the following    approximate percentages were arrived at: Discovery and    Exploration, 6%; Colonial Period, 12%; Revolutionary    Period, 12%; Early Nineteenth Century, ' 30%; Middle    Nineteenth Century, 11 %; Late Nineteenth Century,    9",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/828,828,829.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/829.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

State, county, and local histories of the southeast are    numerous. Naturally, the section on North Carolina,    which contains 2,450 volumes, is the most extensive.    Something of its completeness can be seen from the fact    that the S'ondley North Caroliniana has supplied the Fed­eral    Writers' Project with information necessary for the    complete verification of the statements on 283 markers    erected by the North Carolina Historical ~ ommission.    , The distribution of the material covering the south­east    may be indicated by listing the rare books dealing    with the history of each state: North Carolina, 77; South    Carolina, 35; Virginia, 29; Georgia, 13; Tennessee,    12; Kentucky, 8; Maryland, 8; Alabama, 7; Missis­sippi,    3; Louisiana, 2; Texas, 2.    The biographical section is good in general and is    excellent for the southeast. There are more than 650    volumes of collective biographies, and 2,150 volumes of    individual biographies. This is admirably supple~ ented    by filed clippings.    There are several hundred speeches and addresses by    contemporaries dealing with such subjects as the tariff,    nullification, slavery, reconstruction, and the silver issue.    This material is especially gOod for the period from    around 1840 to about 1876. There are approximately    2,500 pamphlets, many of which are not copyrighted.    For this reason, it is quite probable that many of them    are not ' to be found in the average library or even in the    Library of Congress.    10",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/829,829,830.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/830.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are also the    trials of Sir Walter Raleigh, Mary Queen of Scots, Cap­tain    Kidd, Lawrence Braddon and Hugh Speke, Lord    Bacon, Anthony, Earl of Shaftsbury, Eugene Arams, the    last trial for Atheism in England, and the Tichborne    Claimant.    The subject of American trials includes The Confes­sions    of J ereboam o. Beauchamp,. Reports of the Triais    of Aaron Burr, 1808; Trial and Acquittal of Ed: ward    Shippen, 1805; Trial of John H. Surratt ( John Wilkes    Booth); Trial of J. T. Cluverius, Richmond, 18.87; Trial    of David M. Furches, Raleigh, 1901; and the famous    hypothetical question , in the trial of Harry K. Thaw,    1907.    North Carolina law is represented very fully. The    Sondley has the revisals of North Carolina laws, begin­ning    with Swann's Revisals of 1752 ( popularly known    as The Yellow Jacket) and continuing through all the    succeeding editions of that publication, including the    1925 Amendments.

RARE AND UN/ USUAL BOOKS    Only a very few of the rare and unusual possessions    of the Sondley Library may be mentioned in a pamphlet    of this size.    While the Library owns only one example of hand    printing ( a page from a Book of Hours, eleventh or    twelfth century, illuminated on parchment), it has valu­able    material on the art of illumination and on the mak­ing    of books before the invention of printing.    The Sondley owns three Incunabula;    1. St. Jerome's Epistles, printed in Parma, Italy, 1480,    2 vols., original vellum binding.    2. Nicholas de Lyra's Bible Commentary, the first    ever printed, Nuremberg, Germany, 1485. ( Vol.    IV.)    3. The Nuremberg Chronicle, printed in Nuremberg,    1493.    There are numerous examples of the work of the great    printers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, includ��ing    thirty- two Elzevirs as well as books from the presses    of Aldus of Venice, Etienne of Paris, Koberger of Nurem-'    berg, Plantin of Antwerp, and Totyll of London.

EARLY NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES    Though the files of certain early newspapers are not    sufficiently complete to be of real research value, there    are some interesting examples to be seen, including several    early North and South Carolina publications, such as    The Camden Gazette of North Carolina, 1817- 1819; The    Camden Confederate, complete; The Edenton Gazette of    North CaroUna, 1759, and one sheet of a 1787 issue with    letter by John Iredell; Greensborough Tt'm. es, 1859; The    North Carolina Standard, published in Raleigh, vol. 3,    Nov. 1836- Sept. 1837; and the Cherokee Phoenix, Feb.    25, 1829.

As many subjects as possible are being brought    up to date by means of clippings and pamphlets as well    as by books.

To be able to present a library "" full grown and rea    for use"" to the city of Washington in five to six months time is n    small aocomplishment.

Not    the Pack Memorial. It was twenty years    later that George Willis Pack made his    gift of the bank building on the site of    the present Pack.    And not the "" Public"" Library. It was    twenty years after that, in 1919, that the    private organization, with paid subscrip­tions,    was turned over to the city and    became a free, public library.    But on January 25, 1879, according to    the weekly . Vorth Carolina Citizen, "" the    members of the Asheville Reading Club    have formed themselves into the Ashe­ville    Library Association, which body    has been incorporated under the statute    la ws of the state.""    The Citizen headlined its story, "" A    ~ Iove in the Right Direction.""    ~ ortherners who had moved to the    region took part in the new association.    For example, one of the library's first    homes was "" a shelf in the law office of    Walter S. Cushman, recently of Con­necticut,    in the Court House.""    ( This, incidentally, was the handsome    new Court House, erected in the middle    of what is now l) ack Square. The old    one had burned down in the spring of    ' 65. The conflagration was so spectacu­lar    that Otto Hildebrand leapt upon hi~    horse and galloped through the stret: ts,    shouting, "" The Yankees are here, and    old Ashetown is burning up!"")    But it was the families of the earl\ ­settlers    who took the most active part.    In particular it was three intrepid maiden    ladies.    They were Miss Fanny Patton, of the    Patton avenue Pattons, Miss Anna C.    Aston, of the Aston street Astons, and    y[ iss Annie Chunn, of the Chunn's Cove    Chunns.    The trio made up the Executive Com­mittee    of the new Association, and they    went to work with a will. They collected    subscriptions ($ 1.50 a year). Above    all. they collected books. Together they    toured the town ( a short tour, to be sure)    riding in a buggy behind an old blind,    or almost blind, horse said to have been    named "" O'Toole.""

But the ladies persevered.    On April 17, according to the Citizen,    "" A horse attached to a buggy, occupied    by three young ladies, became frightened    on College street and commenced back­ing.    The young ladies jumped from the    buggy only in time to be saved from    falling over the bluff with the horse    and buggy.""    This trio, cloaked in modest anonym­ity,    can only have been the Executive    Committee. The buggy was broken, inci­dentally,    but O'Toole was unhurt.    On May 9, from 8 to 10, the ladies    gave an "" entertainment"" in honor of the    opening of the library the next day.    There were speeches by Senator T. F.    Davidson and Judge R. P. Dick, "" songs    well rendered by some of the young    gentlemen of the town,"" and ice cream    and cake.    Next day, in an upstairs room on the    north side of the Square, the library was    opened. Hours 12 to 1, changed later in    the month, "" for the convenience of the    public,"" to 4 to 5.    Gifts continued to come in. William    T. Adams of Boston, who wrote Horatio    Alger- like stories under the name of    Oliver Optic, sent 54 volumes of his    own works. John Evans Brown of Ashe­ville,    who had gone away to make, and    had made, his fortune, sent books all the    way from Christchurch, New Zealand.    The Library was launched.    Continuity    It is good to report that family in­terest    in the Library continues over the    years. The great- niece of Miss Fanny    Patton and the grandson of John Evans    Brown are both currently serving as    board members of Friends of the Library.    The Year    What was Asheville like in 1879,    when the Library came into existence?    Though the telegraph line had snaked    up the mountain two years before, it was    still an isolated little town, really a    village. The activities of President    Rutherford B. Hayes, whose son was    later to settle here ( he farmed several    West Asheville acres near the present    Haywood Road Branch Library' and    lived in. a house that eventually became    the . hOJl) e of Olive Tilford Dargan, 5.8    : Palsam'.

The chief news in the Citizen, week    after week after week, was really not    news at all. It was the same old story,    as it had been for nearly fifty years: the    Railroad has not yet come through.    The Western North Carolina Line had    come as far west as Old Fort. The Ashe­ville    and Spartanburg line had reached    Hendersonville, so that supplies no    longer had to be hauled from Augusta,    or SaJisbury- three- week trips.    But Asheville remained remote. Here    is a correspondent's report of the trip    from the end of the line at Old Fort;    "" After partaking of a good solid din­ner    at Capt. Joseph Burgin's hotel, you    find one of the well- known Clemmons    line of stages in waiting to convey you    to Asheville; and there is no disguising    the fact that you are favored with a    genuine old fashion stage ride-- a luxury    in this day of railroads. The distance    is but 24 miles, yet owing to the pecu­liar    nature of the country through which    you pass, seven or eight hours are con­sumed    ere the destination is reached.""    The steam cars had already traversed    most of the nation. Yet it was only late    in this same year, 1879, that Edison in­vented    the incandescent electric Hght,    maintaining incandescence for over forty    hours.    "" Christmas passed comparatively quiet    in this locality,"" reported the Citizen in    the first issue of the new year. "" There    were a few cases of drunk and down in    our ' burg, and the usual amount of egg­nogg    drinking.""    It was cold, and ice was being brought    in from the river. "" It didn't last half    the summer last year, and had to be ~ ­ported    from Charlotte at enormous    cost."" The cold cut down on attendance    at an entertainment given by the Bear    Wallow Choir at the Court House.    A bank opened, the first in town since    the Civil War. A silver comet band was    organized. The Debating Society met.    As the year. passed, Dr. William    Gleitzmann was running his sanitarium    for pulmonary patients. "" Room and    board $ 10 a week."" A $ 5,600 bond issue    which would have allowed the macadam­izing    of Main street failed to pass.

So did the new    Opera House on the third floor of the    Court House, with chairs for 360, and    the first scenery ever viewed in Ashe­ville.

And as the    Citizen pointed out, "" Friday night,    ' East Lynne'.""    Prof. Willoughby Reade, "" humorist    and facialist,"" made an appearance, and    Prof. C. A.

One of the two wells on the Square    was drying up. There were of course no    water or sewer lines, no fire department.    And there were complaints that two    policemen weren't enough.    Then came the headline: "" Daylight    Through Swannanoa Tunnell"" The rail­road    was at last on , its way. To Henry's    Junction, to Azalea, and at last, the    next year, to Asheville. And that made    all the difference.    Within the decade the population was    to quadruple. Tobacco and tourists were    becoming the chief crops. Paved streets,    a water works, a fire department, a    street car line from the Square to the    passenger depot, all followed. Asheville    thrived.    S~ though at a slower pace, did the    Library.    Ice Cream Cones    Because it commemorates the founding    date of the Asheville Public Libraries,    the bookplate of Pack Memorial Public    Library, still in use, is here reproduced.    It was designed by the late Philena A.    Dickey, librarian of the Sondley Collec­tion    for many years. Here is what she    wrote about it in a note to a library    bookplate collector in California who    asked for a Sondley bookplate:    "" I made the original sketch- and it    was adapted for the Sondley in 1931, by    a commercial artist. I used the city sed    and had rosettes of oak leaves in the    corners.    "" The commercial artist to whom the    Trustees gave the sketch to be drawn for    reproduction changed these to the ice    cream cones of the plate.    "" The dates surrounding the seal ~ tand    for the first organization of a subscrip-tion    library 1879, the date when this    became a public library 1919, and the    date when the Sondley Library was    willed to the city by its collector 1931.    ( Pack bookplate has date 1926 when    present library building was completed.)    "" The two dates on the seal indicate    the founding of the town, then known as    Morristown, and the charter of the city    of Asheville.""    The City Seal, picturing Pisgah and    the Rat and, in Latin, the first line of    the 121st Psalm, was designed by Harry    J. Sage, of Field's Jewelry Store. He is    remembered as an excellent designer,    particularly when working in stones    native to these mountains.    And Miss Dickey was right about her    original sketch, now on file in the North    Carolina room.

It's a good round number, 85 ( ex­cept,    of course, for the upper half of    the "" 5"".)    And it would make a good round sum    for people, or organizations, to con­tribute    in honor of the Birthday.    Little Drops of Water,    Little Grains of Sand •    A couple of years ago the soft- drink    machine at Pack, which is kept in the    Soft - drink - machine Room ( For Em­ployees    Only), yielded a small profit.    ( Librarians, being only human, have a    coffee- or soft- drink- break, like every­body    else.)    What to do with , this delightful wind­fall?    The staff pondered, shilly- shaliied,    finally Reached a Decision.    And so a Building Fund for a new    library someday was born.    The profit, all five dollars of it, pur­chased    a share in the city's credit union,    and has been busily drawing interest    ever since.    What with the interest and a few    other items, that rather pathetic initial    sum has. been doubled and re- doubled    many times. The items include an anony­mous    gift of $ 500, another $ 100 from a    loyal library patron, a contribution    squeezed from the tight budget of    Friends of the Library, even further    profits from the soft- drink machine.    Today the Building Fund totals ap­proximately    $ 847.68.    Still a rather pathetic sum, you may    say. But it is a beginning, a beginning    that absolutely had to be made.    Little drops of water    Among the larger cities and    counties in North Carolina    Asheville and Buncombe County    rank    5th in population    4th in library income    3rd in total circulation    1st in per capita circulation    $. 85    $ 8.50    $ 85    $ 850    $ 8,500    $ 85,000    The imagination boggles.    Contribute to what, you ask. To the    Staff's Fund for a new library.    Little drops of water . . . .    Pack Library is open 9 a. m. to 9 p. m. Monday thru Friday, Saturday 9 to 6.    Top Floor    There has been an international fla­vor    about the Thomas Wolfe Collection    at Pack in recent weeks.    Scholars from overseas who are study­ing    or writing about the author almost    invariably make three extended stops    on their tour of this country: Harvard,    where the \ Villiam Wisdom Collection    of manuscripts is lodged; Chapel Hill,    from which "" Volfe was graduated; and    Asheville. The collection here is for the    most part a library, or reference collec­tion,    kept as complete and up- to- date as    possible.    Dr. Helena Norwid, who teaches    American Literature at the University    of \ Yars. aw, Poland, was one recent visi­tor.    ( Dr. Norwid was entertained to    learn of \ Varsaw, N. C., which was years    ago a whistle- stop on the AsheviIle­\\""    eaverville street car line. It was the    name given her country place by the late    Sara Coleman I&gt; orter, widO\ v of O.    Henry.)    Other visitors have been I&gt; rof. Man­ning    Clark, of Canberra, Australia, and    Camille Bourniquel, of NeuiIly, France,    literary director of the periodical,    J: Esprit.    .\ nd from Germany came Gerrit Rasch    of the University of Heidelberg and    Prof. Hans Helmcke of the University­of    ) Iainz.    Andrew Turnbull, of Cambridge,    )[ ass., has also spent considerable time    here working on a biography of Wolfe.    Turnbull is the author of the recent    biography of Scott Fitzgerald, and editor    of"" the current Fitzgerald Letters, many    of which were written from the Grove    Park Inn here, and from Tryon.    These scholars have need of physical    strength as well as brains. It's a long    climb up all those flights of stairs to    the top floor of Pack.",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/902,902,903.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/903.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The structure is of contemporary design, the two longer walls of    the rectangular building of glass, and the end walls of brick. The fur­nishings,    including the stacks, charging- desk, catalog, tables, step- stools,    book- truck and chairs are of natural birch, complimenting the birch used in    the interior of the building. Occasional pieces, including overstuffed    chairs in Swedish red and ~ ellow and wrought iron magazine racks, add a    note of informality, color and comfort. The book collection was entirely    n~ with the exception of the small reference collection. .. sheville achieved    another "" first"" in the designing, building, eqUipping, and opening the first    true branch librar-, f in the State of North Carolina.    Equally important in the picture of library expansion last year    was the acquisition of No. 10 South Pack Square which doubled the first    floor area of the Pack Library. In previous years, the annual report has    called attention to the crowded conditions prevailing in the central library.    This major expansion relieved crowded conditions in all departments by pro­viding    additional facilities and storage space. The area was completely    remodeled to provide a spacious, well- lighted reading- room, additional metal    stacks, and adequate offices. The basement area was designed to serve as    bookmobile head~ uarters with easy access for loading and unloading the many    books which go out dai~. It also provides storage space for reference    material which is used only occasionally. The new annex was designed by    ~ lr., Antho~' .

The new addition has re­lieved    the crowded work area in the Pack ~ ibrary J and today the mail can    be checked J and the books catalosued and processed with maximum efficiency.    One other major project was started and is still in process.    The Librarian was directed by the library board to lend the Pack Reference    Collection to the Sondley Reference Library. The books were to be shelved    as one collection which constituted a major shelving and cataloging problem.    The canbination is of such magnitude that canbined with routine work, it    will require a long period of time for completion.    While extensive expansion has been in progress, Pack Memorial    and the Market Street Branch have gone about their main business of circu­lating    books. ~ total of 390,313 volumes were circulated fran Pack alone.    The children's department under the direction of Mrs. Bessie Ralston was    responsible for 112,199 of this total. The bookmobile circulated 126,741,    a gain of over 10,000 from the previous year. This increase in circulation    indicates that the new bookmobile presented by the Coca- Cola Bottling Com­pany    is able to serve more patrons and carry a larger stock. The adult    circulation c~ ntinued as heavy as in recent years with a total of 151,373.    The Market Street Branch with a bookstock of 5,876 circulated 14,363 volumes.    The book collection continued to grow. Approximately 5,000 books    were added to Pack, bringing the total collection to 84,203.

Fran the time of the opening of the new Pack reading- roan, per­iodicals    and newspapers have been extensively used. The library r13ceives    225 periodicals and 9 d~ ily newspapers and there is never an hour of the    day that the roan is not canfortably filled. It is my feeling that the    librar, y patrons are making better use of periodicals which have been re­ceived    for years, but never adequately displayed. The Market Street Branch    receives 33 periodicals and 9 newspapers. The Haywood Road Branch receives    5 newspapers and 17 periodicals.    Every member of the staff has cooperated to the fullest in pro­viding    good library service to our patrons. The reference library answered    more"" than 6,000 questions; the children's department has stimulated inter­est    in reading with rnaIlf excellent story hours and programs for young pa­trons;    the catalog department has had many books ready for circulation on    the day of publication; the adult circulation staff has selected thousands    of books for patrons as well as directing patrons to special departments,    and the boolanobile has continued to serve the residents of Buncanbe County.    The Exhibition Roan activities have been so closely allied with    the activities of the Friends of the Library that in many cases it is hard    to separate one fran the other.

Carroll. The series of three chamber music con­certs    by the faculty of Transylvania Music Camp, the exhibition honoring    Carl Sandburg on his 75th birthday, the series of six movies from the    Museum of Modern Art, and the exhibition from the American Federation of    Arts were among the outstanding features of the year. A new service was    initiated with the weekly recorded music hours at the Pack Library and the    Market Street Branch. Another service offered for the first time was the    circulation of adult educational films provided by the North Carolina    Film Project. From September 1, 1952 through June 12, 1953, 59 films    circulated 546 times to an audience of 19,486 persons. A series of eleven    discussion m~ etings were led by Mrs. Helen T. Reed on the Declaration of    Independence and the United States Constitution. These programs were    sponsored by the American Library Association American Heritage Project    and were well attended. The Market Street Branch held a similar series    of discussion meetings, led by Mrs. Reba Harrison. A calendar of events    for the year is appended to this report.    The record expenditure of 1106,648.91 reflects the physical    expansion of library facilities in all the libraries. Of this sum,    $ 30,348.10 was capital outlay.

LIGON, LIBRARIAN    ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA    TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE CITY OF ASHEVILLE LIBRARIES:    The report of the Librarian for the fiscal year 1955- 1956 is herewith    submitted:    The Library continued as the principal information center in this area. and    all departments functioned in the usual way•. While there were no major changes.    effort was continuous to improve those services already in progress. Materials for    answering questions on many subjects were enlarged upon, and reference volumes    ranging from a dictionary on tobacco to a new edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica    were added. Whether members of our community are interested in art, music,    literature., or science. current books are at all times ava. ilable, except in highly    technical fields •. Every reference classification has been under constant surveillance,    resulting in up- to- date replacements. additional new material on timely subjects, and    extension of subjects such as art"" music, and literature. Magazines offer a recurrent    study,- and each year some titles are added and some are deleted if they no longer    meet the present needs. , Special attention has been given to the replacement of hand­books,    yearbooks and annuals of all kinds"" making it possible for the Reference    Librarians to produce correct information with greater speed. Patrons frequently    comment on the noticeable number of new volumes appearing on our reference    shelves, all of which have extended a wider reference service to the public. An    automatic replacement plan has been put into practice whereby orders are placed    from the Catalog Department annually, biennially, or even longer. It has ever been    the purpose of the Libra, rian to IIgo the second mile ll to accommodate the demands of    a patron, and this spirit has beenre'flected throughout the staff.    The highlight of the year was the concentrated study of the Sondley Reference    Library, which culminated in surveys by Dr•. Harry M•. Lydenberg and Mr. John    C. Wyllie.,' The combined thinking of these two librarians and scholars resulted in    an extensive long- range project for the Asheville system. The joint recommendation    that the circulation facilities of the main library be decentralized to branch libraries    at strategic locations,. and the use of the main building as a reference center,- found    unanimous approval.    In gen, eral circulation, a . constant survey of non- fiction was in process and,    again,- out- of- date titles were withdrawn and replaced by new editions and new titles.",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/922,922,923.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/923.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over- the- counter circulation showed an increase in non- fiction    over the past year•. Availability of good titles in paper- back editions at a nominal    cost, television, and corner drug store libraries had a marked effect on general    circulation. However, it appears that the library is now being used more for    study and serious reading. Television programs have aroused interest in many    subjects, and it is natural to turn to the library for additional information•. A    concentrated effort was made to recover books from long- delinquent borrowers,    and, by perseverance, almost all of the long- overdue books were returned•    . The Children's Department continued to serve young people in a pleasing    and efficient manner•. The Children's Librarian gave freely of her time and talents    by speaking frequently to children, clubs, and church groups in the interest of the    library.    The BookInobile Department completed an inventory of its holdings and    completely reorganized the schedule for more efficient service.    The Exhibition Room offered a wide variety of continuous exhibitions and    entertainments .. Two outstanding shows were North Carolina Writers in July    and N. Brock Photographs and Paintings in January and February. The Brock ex­hibition    proved so popular that it was held over an extra month. The teen- age and    reading rooms were used in October for an exciting exhibition entitled "" Your News­paper    Goes to Press."" Through the cooperation of the Asheville Citizen- Times    Company, all the "" tools of the trade"" were on display, from blank copy paper to    the finished newspaper. An A. P. teletype was in constant operation and attracted    wide attention. The exhibit lasted · only during National Newspaper Week, with a    conservative estimate of at least five hundred Asheville residents seeing it each    day. Lectures, concerts, films, puppet shows, and story hours also contributed    to the activities of the Department. More and more the window ledges facing Pack    Square were put to use and attracted many interested viewers•. The purchase of    the new Steinway grand piano was the largest and most exciting addition to the    Department during the year. This large undertaking was financed by Friends of    the Library, a large industrial corporation, interested individuals, and the City    of Asheville. Dunham's Music House, where the piano was purchased, was generous    in terms and price, to say nothing of the efforts of members of the organization to    place the right instrument of concert calibre in the Exhibition Room. Out of a total    of fourteen exhibits,. eight were assembled in the library. This number of assembled    exhibits was greater than in any previous year.    The Haywood Road Branch Library continued to prove as popular as in    previous years. It is now evident that the Library has become an integral part of    the community. The resignation in March of Mrs•. Doan R .. Ogden as Branch Librarian    was received with many expressions of regret, both from the library staff and the    library patrons. Mrs.. Charles E. Lyons accepted a temporary appointment to this    position.",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/923,923,924.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/924.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Market Street Branch continued to provide good service for the Negro    residents of the community. The Branch is gradually acquiring a record collection    for weekly concerts and special festivals. Friends of the Library as a group and    as individuals have provided twenty- six albums•    . The Thomas Wolfe collection reached a state of completeness whereby it    became a source of factual material - both workable and useJul. . The main body    of the collection consists of approximately 2,. 000 items, including first editions,    pictures, short stories, newspaper articles and critical reviews.    Among the gifts received by the Library were valuable books on Japan, from    General Robert L. Eichelberger; a William Jennings Bryan Association item, from    Mr.. D.

This room, fully equipped with the needed tools for research, in­cluding    a typewriter, stand, and typist's chair, was used by writers, ministers and    scholars. This memorial was entirely financed by Friends of the Library - of which    organization Mrs. Ordway was a charter member - and her personal friends,. both    in A sheville and in other parts of the country.    A glass display case, designed by the Six Associates for the purpose of    showing rare Sondley volumes and items, was ordered toward the close of the fiscal    year.    . Additional metal shelving was ordered before the end of the year to provi"" de    space for the Sondley volumes •. Another request in the 1956- 57 budget should take    care of all the shelves which will be needed to complete the terms of the Lydenberg­Wyllie    recommendations, which called for concentrated shelving on the top floor    of the Library to alleviate space problems.    The local newspapers have been generous with space and good reporting.    Special Library functions have received excellent coverage in news releases and    editorials. The activities of a municipal library are dependent for their success on    the cooperation and coverage of the local press, but it also is true that the Library    furnishe s the ideas and information for many informative feature articles and news    stories appearing in the loc. al newspapers•. To date th. e a. ssociation has been mutually    helpful •    . Friends of the Library under the able direction of Miss Mary Parker,    gave generously in time, ideas and financial support.

As a result of making available the gem    stones for exhibition, the North Carolina Mineral Society presented the case    in which the collection is now permanently mounted and displayed in the    Library. A selective bibliography of gem and mineral materials in the    library was compiled by the Reference Department for distribution to mem...    bel's and visitors of the Southern Appalachian Mineral Society at their    convention.    Dr. Sprinza Weitenblatt made. a gift of $ 100 for the Market Street    Branch in December, 1958.    In February of 1959, a gift of $ 500 was received from the Pen and    Plate Club as an expression of appreciation of the service rendered by the    Library to Asheville residents and, particularly, members of the Pen and    Plate Club. This gift was used to purchase a much- needed and expensive    reference volume and to provide extra volumes for the North Asheville Branch.    A complete set of Beatrix Potter characters in bronze was given    as an 80th anniversary present to the Children's Department of Pack Library    by Friends of the Library.    Friends of the Library also provided a research alcove in memory    of Mr. George H. Wright, whose , death in September, 1958, came as a    great shock and loss to the library staff. Mr. Wright had served for almost    50 years as a Board member, and during these years had given generously of    himself and his talents in the interest of the Asheville Library System.    .. 2 -",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/934,934,935.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/935.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moseley housed a collection of    400+ volumes between libraries at his    residence in Rocky Point and his office    in Brunswick Town.    Moseley and other book collectors    such as William Hooper, Wilmington    Revolutionary statesman and signer of    the Declaration of Independence, maintained libraries for    private use.    Volumes from both their collections are housed in    the rare book collection at the New    Hanover County Public Library.    Church Collections    “ I ndeed, my Lord,” the Reverend    Richard Marsden, rector of St.    James, wrote in 1735, “ it would be    a great act of charity without delay    to supply this part of the province at    least with good books.”    In 1755, the first shipment arrived    for the St. James and St. Philips    Parishes from the English Society    for the Propagation of the Gospel in    Foreign Parts.    Religious treatises, Bibles and    prayer books made up the bulk of the collection, although    it probably included some volumes on philosophy, law,    history, literature and grammar.    An Early Lending Library    T he only pre- Revolutionary circulating library in North    Carolina was the Cape Fear Library, which operated    from 1760 to 1780. Little is known about the library, but it    was probably supported by a group of educated men who    shared in the purchase of books of interest to the group.    One volume remains at the New Hanover County    Public Library: Rollin’s History of the Arts and Sciences of    the Ancients. The book, bound in leather, has Cape Fear    Library stamped in gold on the cover.    Reading Rooms    D uring the first half of the 19th century, reading rooms    established by newspapers, book stores, coffee houses    and debating societies became very popular.    Borrowers paid a yearly fee for the circulation of books,    pamphlets and newspapers.    Wilmington’s first known reading room    was opened in 1808 by William Hasell,    owner of the Wilmington Gazette.    In 1833, Thomas Loring, editor of the    People’s Press & Wilmington Advertiser, boasted    of having 150 newspapers from 20 states in    his reading room, which stayed open until    9: 00 pm.    In 1836, William C. Jackson advertised that he would    rent volumes from his bookshop for 6 ¼ cents per week.    Literary Groups    W ith the completion of the railroad in 1840 and    improved access to the port, residents arrived    from all parts of the United States as well as from other    countries.    Debating societies, also known as lyceums and    chatauquas, were in vogue. The groups provided a forum    for their members to read, speak,    write and debate about the scientific,    moral, religious and political issues    of the day.    First Library Association    I n 1849, the Wilmington Mercantile    Library Association was created    as a club to which members paid a    yearly fee, purchased books and circulated them among    themselves.    In 1855, the club was absorbed into the Wilmington    Library Association. Organized before    the Civil War, the Association became    the town’s leading literary center for the    remainder of the 19th century.    In 1856, the city provided “ lecture    rooms” for a Public Library and Reading    Room in the governmental complex which    included City Hall and Thalian Hall. In    1858, the Wilmington Library Association    moved its collection there from a building on Water Street    and stayed open throughout the Civil War.    Civil War and Reconstruction    W ith the fall of Fort Fisher to Federal forces in January    1865, the future of the library became uncertain.    The Freedman’s Bureau appropriated the library rooms for    its operations. Two years later, however, the books were    back, and a complete catalog of the contents listed 1300    titles.    The move was short- lived. During Reconstruction it    was decided that the Association, lacking a legal charter,    had no right to exist on city property.

It was the heyday of public    speaking. The Association sponsored    numerous reading clubs, debates and    musical entertainments. Orators from    across the globe were heard by eager    Wilmingtonians.    A Tale of Two Cities    W hile the Wilmington Library Association’s members    were white citizens, Wilmington’s African- American    community had its own literary societies, lyceums and    libraries.    As early as 1870, there were organized groups of black    Wilmingtonians whose leaders were principally ministers    and free blacks educated in the North.    One such group was the Colored Literary Society,    which provided night school for men.    Some of the larger African- American churches had    libraries. St. Stephen’s AME Church provided a community    library in its annex building.    Forums for public speaking were    promoted by groups such as the    Benjamin Banneker Literary and Library    Association in the 1880s and the Daniel    A. Payne Lyceum in the 1890s.    Frederick Douglass, world famous    abolitionist, author and civil rights leader,    spoke in City Hall on August 1, 1872.    It was not until 1926 that the city    began supporting a free public library for    African- Americans.    The First Librarian    D espite the popularity of its programs and collection, the    Wilmington Library Association,    headed by extraordinary bibliophile    Dr. Thomas Fanning Wood, could    not raise enough money for rent, new    books and a librarian’s salary. Finally,    in the 1880s, the group decided to    give its extensive collection to the    newly formed Young Men’s Christian    Association Library.    A public outcry ensued, and one    generous man saved the library for    another decade.    Captain William H. Bixby was the first Wilmington    District Engineer for the US Army Corps of Engineers    from 1884- 1891. Bixby volunteered to manage the library,    and he donated over $ 1,000 to update    the collection.    Wilmington’s first professional    librarian was hired: Miss A. L. Sargent    of Lowell, Massachusetts. Miss    Sargent employed the latest library    standards of cataloging and collection    development.    Captain Bixby had electric lights    installed and extended library hours. By the time he left    Wilmington in 1891, there were 4100 volumes in the    collection. Membership had increased dramatically and    circulation doubled.    With Bixby’s departure in 1891 and the death of Dr.    Wood in 1892, the Wilmington    Library Association finally    relinquished their holdings to the    YMCA in 1893. The Association    continued to meet there until it    dissolved at the end of 1899. Many    of the Association’s records are in the historical collection    of the New Hanover Public Library.    A Determined Group of Women    A fter the demise of the Wilmington Library Association,    the North Carolina Sorosis, the oldest federated    women’s club in North Carolina, took up the cause for a    Free Public Library.    In 1901, Miss Margaret Littlejohn Kingsbury introduced    the idea of petitioning the city government to provide space    for a public library.    In the meantime, the Board of Aldermen turned    down the offer of a free Carnegie Library, considering the    required annual appropriation of $ 2500 to be too much of    a burden to taxpayers.    Sorosis Club members persisted in their efforts. They    opened a temporary library in the Masonic Temple on    Front Street and later in the new Odd Fellows building    on South 3rd. In 1904, they relentlessly pressured the city    aldermen for a permanent location. “ It is a shame and    a disgrace,” they argued, “ that the largest and wealthiest    town in the state has not an institution of this kind.”    In 1906 their dream came true.

Sorosis, a Greek    term for the cluster of    flowers on a stem, hardly    conveys the indomitable    spirit of the women determined to establish a public library    in Wilmington.    In March 1901, Sorosis member Miss    Margaret Littlejohn Kingsbury introduced    the subject of a free library for the Port    City; and the club launched a campaign.    A library tea was held to which members    brought books to    form the nucleus    of the library. They    also solicited aid    from the community in the form of    maps, charts and periodicals as well    as books.    Fees for Service    T he Sorosis library grew exponentially. The women held    benefits to raise money for books which, by 1904, they    circulated out of a room in the Masonic Temple on North    Front Street. In spite of minimal expenses, the library still    had to charge patrons 5 cents per week per book. The    library was only open on Wednesdays and Saturdays.    In 1905, they moved their 1200 volume library to the    newly- constructed Odd Fellows building on the northwest    corner of Third and Princess Streets.    Still convinced that the library should be on city    property, Sorosis members lobbied for space in underused    rooms in City Hall. In February 1905, the Board of    Aldermen presented a bill to the State Legislature to    empower them to establish a public library; but by the end    of the year no progress had been made.    Public Sentiment Raised    I n March 1906, the Sorosis circulated a petition among    citizens demanding that the Board of Aldermen    appropriate $ 720 per year to support the library. The    appropriation would cover rent at the Odd Fellows Hall    and a librarian’s salary. Except for Sundays, the free library    would be open every day until 10 pm.    This ambitious plan won over the hearts and minds    of taxpayers. Civic groups, churches, school children and    others began to lobby for a public library. The Wilmington    Messenger newspaper editorialized: “ it does not look like    the right thing for a city the size of Wilmington to put the    entire task of supplying a public library upon the ladies of    the city.”    The Women Have Their Way    T he Sorosis cleverly volunteered to give their library to    the municipality if the city would fund and maintain    it. The Board of Aldermen finally agreed to appropriate    $ 1200 per year toward the establishment and maintenance    of a public library; furthermore, they accepted the plan to    put the public library in City Hall,    “ a public building, where all have    ready access and privilege.”    In August 1906, contracts were    awarded to renovate the second    floor of City Hall for library    purposes. A Carnegie Library    School graduate, Miss Jessie Hopkins of Atlanta, was hired    to catalog the collection properly, oversee the move to the    new location, and train the locally hired librarian, Miss    Elizabeth Waddell.    In October 1906, mothers of    Wilmington were asked to help the    cause of furnishing the children’s    section of the new library. Steam heat    was installed enabling the library to    be open during the winter months.    In early November 1906,    furniture arrived, including “ several    dozen comfortable chairs of the latest library pattern.” It    was decided that hours would    be 10 to 7 daily, and that    library privileges would be    free with “ the filling out of an    application for membership in    the library.”    On November 30, 1906,    Wilmington’s first public    library was dedicated. Mayor    Alfred Moore Waddell, on behalf of the city, formally    received the 1700 books of the Sorosis Library.

Young ladies dressed    to represent different books served refreshments.”    After the first week in business, the newspaper reported    that hundreds of citizens had patronized the library. The    fiction department was the most popular, followed by travel,    biography and philosophy. Favorite magazines included    Harper’s Monthly, Ladies’    Home Journal, Munsey’s,    Etude, and Outing.    The most popular    program was the story    telling hour held on    Friday afternoons at 3: 30.    Children aged 9 years and    under would attend one    Friday and children from    10 to 14 the next Friday.    The first storyteller to    delight the children was    Miss Essie Meares.    From October 1906 to October 1910, 5025 books were    added to the collection, with donations of books coming    from sources such as the Wilmington Library Association,    Hemenway School and the Firemen’s Library. Many    individuals gave books, some more than 100 volumes.    Gift Day    L ibrary use the first year was overwhelming, and it was    apparent that government funding was not going to    cover the cost of keeping the doors open. The library’s first    anniversary was celebrated as “ Gift Day.” A letter circulated    throughout the community declared: “ Our Public Library    will be one year old on the 30th day of November; and,    as it has outgrown our expectations in every respect,    it naturally calls for a greater outlay of money than the    present appropriation covers.” The library regularly held    exhibitions, benefits and other fundraisers to purchase    books.    Board of Trustees Established    A n Act of the General Assembly, ratified the 21st day    of February 1907, provided that “ It shall be the duty    of the Board of Aldermen of the city of Wilmington at its    regular meeting in April 1907, and biennially thereafter, to    elect five citizens of said city, two of whom shall be women,    as Trustees, to have control and maintain one or more free    libraries for the use of the public of Wilmington.” Fittingly,    the female members of the Board of Trustees were often    officials in the North Carolina Sorosis.    Electric Lights    I n 1908, the library Board of Trustees yielded to popular    sentiment and decided to keep the library open until    9 pm; however, they warned that larger donations would    be necessary if a night librarian was to be hired. They    encouraged monetary gifts by placing a small bank for    contributions in the reading room.    By 1909, an electric light system was installed which    allowed the reading room to remain open from 10: 00 am    to 9: 30 pm.    The First North Carolina Collection    I n 1910, the library    Board of Trustees    asked for donations    regarding the history    of North Carolina.    Thus began the public    library’s North Carolina Collection, the first in the state.    The same year the board successfully requested the city    aldermen to appropriate $ 350 to purchase files of The    Morning Star from 1867.    Library Miscellanea    1916    The librarian reports 8139 volumes in    the collection. Two hundred people    visited the library each day and    approximately 75 of those borrowed    books.    1917    Librarian Alice LeGrand worries    about books that have been in houses    infected by contagious diseases. A    public health official is sent to collect the books and burn    them.

In the early ’ 20s,    monthly telephone service    was 75 cents. The library’s    electric bills averaged $ 15-    $ 20 per month. The cost    of a book was about $ 1.00,    and a $ 3.95 map of the United States was considered a    major purchase. In 1923, a 30- volume set of Encyclopedia    Americana cost $ 144.    The library spent $ 15- 20 per month in subscriptions.    The Wilmington Morning Star cost $ 7 a year, The Charlotte    Observer, $ 9, and The New York Times,    $ 10.50.    In a growing community of 33,357,    the library’s yearly appropriation    from the city was $ 2,000— only $ 300    more than the initial sum provided    at its opening in 1906.    With nowhere else to cut corners,    library hours were reduced in order to raise salaries.    Fees Charged    C ounty residents paid $ 2 per year    for library privileges, but school    teachers were exempt. Transients were    charged $ 3 per month. Popular fiction    was rented out for 2 cents per day until    the book was paid for.    Over the course of the decade,    income from fines and rental fees increased from about    $ 200 per year to an average of $ 145 per month in 1929.    The Citizens Pitch In    T he North Carolina Sorosis, the Colonial Dames, the    New Hanover Teacher’s Association and the King’s    Daughters were among the many groups that raised funds    or donated books to the library.    The Knights of Columbus purchased The Catholic    Encylopedia for the library, and the Luther League, a youth    group from St. Paul’s Lutheran Church, donated The Works    of Martin Luther.    Noteworthy Individuals    M r. Swift M. Boatwright was appointed to the library    Board of Trustees when it was organized in 1909.    Serving until his death in 1921, Mr. Boatwright hardly ever    missed a board meeting or an opportunity to speak publicly    on behalf of the library. Concerned with the problem of    noise in the library, he is responsible for having SILENCE    placards hung in conspicuous places.    After Mr. Boatwright’s death, Mr.    Eric Norden filled his vacant seat on the    board. An engineer, he was concerned    about safety. He urged city authorities    to repair shifting walls and update the    electrical system. He had new lights    installed and was instrumental in    measuring and ordering new shelving,    including space for 3,500 volumes on the    library’s old balcony.    Miss Margaret L. Gibson, an active    member of the North Carolina Sorosis,    was elected vice- chairman of the board    in 1909. In 1921, she became chairman,    and she remained chair until 1926. North    Carolina Governor Bickett appointed her    to represent the state at the American    Library Association    meeting in 1920.    She was elected vice- president of the    Association’s North Carolina branch    in 1922.    Miss Frances Jewett was Chief    Librarian from 1919 to 1923, when    she left to become the librarian at    New Hanover High School.    Miss Sue Hardin, hired in 1923, became the longtime    assistant librarian.    Miss Emma    T he most enduring decision of the library board was    to hire Miss Emma Woodward as Chief Librarian in    1924.    Miss Woodward had previously worked for three years    as Day Assistant Librarian, but she left in 1918 for Camp    Lee, Virginia, where she stayed for two years until the close    of the First World War. For the next four years, she worked    and studied in a variety of library settings from Illinois to    South Carolina.    She returned to her hometown in 1924 armed with    knowledge, energy and enthusiasm. Popularly known as    “ Miss Emma,” she ran the Wilmington    Public Library for the next 28 years.    The Silver Screen    I n 1924, Wilmington’s Bijou    theater, North Carolina’s oldest    motion picture house, showed The    Leatherstocking Tales.

The Wilmington Morning Star raved that “ The watching    of this glorious story unfold on the screen makes one forget    the... scientific marvels of our highly civilized twentieth    century.”    Presidential Ties    I n 1924, the death of Woodrow Wilson led to a high    demand for books about him.    President Wilson lived in Wilmington when his father    was minister of First Presbyterian Church. Wilson was an    early supporter of a free public library.    In 1906, Wilson donated a signed copy of his    biography of George Washington to the Wilmington    Public Library. The book is preserved in the library’s rare    book collection.    Growing Pains    I n 1925, New Hanover County budgeted $ 500 toward    the operation of the Wilmington Public Library, and a    county representative was added to the library Board of    Trustees.    Overdue book fines rose to between $ 50 and $ 75 per    month, and the head librarian received a monthly salary    of $ 35.    Climbing to the 2nd floor of City Hall was burdensome    for many citizens who lobbied for an elevator. When the    city fathers refused to fund the elevator, the library Board    promoted a plan to convert the Academy of Music ( Thalian    Hall) into a library.    Ultimately, it was decided that the cost of renovating    the space would be as much or more than funding a new    library building.    Time for Change    I n October of 1926, a group representing the city’s    African- American citizens met with the Library Board of    Trustees and asked that they be allowed to use the library.    The board instructed the librarian to    inquire how other libraries in the state    served the black community.    In February 1926, D. C. Virgo,    principal of Williston Industrial School    and representing the Negro Chamber    of Commerce, made application to the    City Council to have Wilmington Public    Library privileges extended to the African- American    community. The council denied the request, stating that    the ( white) public library was founded by the North    Carolina Sorosis who raised the funds to begin the library.    It was suggested that the black community do the same.    The Rev. G. D. Carnes of St. Stephen’s Church led a    committee to raise $ 2,500 to start a library. On May 17,    1926, the fund drive was concluded.    About 2,000 library supporters marched through    the northern part of the city where they gathered at the    African- American baseball park to hear the Rev. Carnes    outline the future library plans. The Wilmington Colored    Library formally opened on June 24, 1926, on the second    floor of the Giblem Masonic Hall located on the southeast    corner of Eighth and Princess Streets.    Fannie Blount, a teacher at Williston School, was    initially in charge of the library. It took a determined    populace less than four months to get their library.    Birthday Celebration    T o celebrate the 20th birthday of the Wilmington Public    Library, the Board of Trustees initiated a campaign to    raise $ 2,000 to purchase new books.    A newspaper editorial lamented, “ Wilmington’s library    has hardly kept pace with the growing demands made upon    it by an ever- awakening public… if room to grow is denied,    the reactions will be manifested in the community for years    to come.”    Feast of Pirates    I n the month of August 1927- 29,    the city held a festival called the    Feast of Pirates. For several days the    merriment embraced locals as well as    visitors from around the state.    During the atmosphere of good    times, the library board decided to begin fundraising for a    new public library.    1928— A Year of Firsts    • A Citizens Library Association ( the first Friends of the    Library) was formed. Rabbi Ripkin of the Temple of Israel    was elected chairman of the association.    • The library opened its first branch at the office of Mrs. C. C.    Hanby, postmistress on Wrightsville Sound.    • The library’s first Children’s Room was dedicated.    What Could Go Wrong?    I n May of 1929, The Wilmington Public Library’s annual    report was impressive. Checkouts had climbed from 2,426    books in 1920 to 92,270— an average increase of 10,000 items    per year.    The newspaper, educators, social clubs and civic groups    praised the library. There was great hope for the construction    of a new facility.    Hopes fell with the crash of the stock market on October    29, 1929.

In the 12- month    period starting six months after the October 1929 Wall    Street debacle, circulation jumped to the 100,000 mark.    This increase continued throughout the era, reaching a    peak of 150,000 in one year.    The newspaper reported that in Wilmington, “ those hit    hardest by the depression turned to the library— not merely    for an easy, free means of passing their periods of enforced    leisure, but for knowledge and information with which to    start a new fight for a living.”    Drastic Measures    I n 1932, the city fathers cut the    library budget by 25%, and library    appropriations were eliminated from    the county budget. Library staff took    a cut in pay, and volunteers kept the    reading room open during evening    hours.    A special collection of books concerning how to find    employment was placed together on a separate, easily    accessible rack.    The library Board of Trustees instructed the librarian    to send all duplicate copies of books to the Wilmington    Colored Library and the public school libraries because    their ability to purchase new books was practically    nonexistent.    Citizens Pitch In    T he Wilmington Relief Association was organized to    respond to local unemployment before the big federal    government programs were inaugurated. One program    sponsored by the    Relief Association    encouraged those    who were lucky    enough to still have    a job to donate a    day’s pay, deducted    from their wages,    to an unemployed    worker. In turn, the jobless worker was paid to perform    various public works duties. The building of Greenfield    Lake’s Community Drive was one of their enduring    projects.    Librarian Emma Woodward sought help from the    Relief Association. Carpenters were dispatched to repair    book stacks. Relief workers cleaned the library, repaired    tattered volumes, inventoried the collection and cataloged    non- fiction books. Miss Woodward also secured salaries    for the women who had been volunteering during evening    hours at the library.    Impressionable Youths    A rtist Claude Howell and    newscaster David Brinkley, two    notable natives, later reflected on the    importance of the library during their    formative years.    Howell ( 1915- 1997) recalled,    “ I’m sure I read every book in the    Wilmington Public Library. Where    else could my imagination travel the    globe? Reading has been important to    me all of my life.”    Brinkley ( 1920- 2003) reminisced,    “ If there is anything worth knowing    about me, it is that    at the age of 10 or    12 I became a semi-permanent    fixture    at the Wilmington    Public Library. I    would go every day after school and stay    till it closed.    My friends kidded me a lot about it,    saying I would read every book in the    library. That’s really where I learned    what little I know.”    Miss Woodward gave David a free    publisher’s copy of Oswald Spengler’s    Decline of the West, saying “ Nobody else    in the county will ever read it.”    He held on to this book throughout    his life.    Washington Tries to Help    I n 1935, the library Board of Trustees decided to ask for    federal Public Works Administration ( PWA) funds to    construct a new library building. The government required    proof that the completed project would be self- supporting.    Local government officials, still weary from “ hard    times,” were unable to promise future support; however,    they did return salaries to pre- Depression levels.    Loss of a Landmark    I n 1936, the federal government appropriated funds to    tear down Wilmington’s US Post Office and build a    new one. The handsome brownstone post office with its    impressive Romanesque arches was only 45 years old.

The North Carolina State Library Commission    sent the state’s first book truck ( the forerunner of the    bookmobile) for a 30- day demonstration in New Hanover    County.    The library board wanted to purchase a similar truck;    but the county refused to fund it, saying that New Hanover    County was so small that it was no hardship for residents    to visit the downtown library.    Hopes Raised    I n 1938, the city public works office applied for a PWA    grant. Funds were sought for twenty projects including:    renovating City Hall; extending sewers; improving streets;    building new sidewalks; installing metal street signs;    remodeling the City Market; extending the fire and police    alarm system; adding new water works; buying land for    new parks, playgrounds and athletic fields; constructing    a city auditorium for conventions and municipal uses; and    building a new public library.    The Bridgers House ( now the Graystone Inn), located    on the northwest corner of Dock and Third streets was    for sale, and many thought    it would make a fine public    library. Others felt that    it was in a poor location    and that renovating it as a    library would cost as much    as constructing a new    building. It was decided    that the location of a new    library facility could wait    until after the bond referendum.    Either way, library supporters were enthusiastically    willing to vote YES.    Progress Blocked    T he PWA was prepared to provide 55% of the funding if    the city would pay for the remainder. Accordingly, the    city held a bond referendum in August, 1938. The bond    was approved overwhelmingly, but a group of concerned    taxpayers decided to contest the outcome. They contended    that the city auditorium, parks, playgrounds, athletic fields    and public library were not public “ necessities” and should    be excluded from public works funding.    The legal dispute eventually reached the North    Carolina Supreme Court, which ruled that while the law    required only a majority of those who voted to pass the    bond referendum for “ necessary” public works, it required    a majority of registered voters to pass a bond to build the    auditorium, parks, playgrounds, athletic fields and public    library.    Back to the Drawing Board    W ith all hopes and votes for a new library defeated,    the Wilmington Public Library had to remain on    the third floor of City Hall. PWA and bond funds allowed    for building renovations, and the work began in earnest.    The library was temporarily moved to the Woolvin    Building at 225 Princess Street. Citizens helped by checking    out as many books as possible to lighten the load. A record    617 books were checked out in one day during the move.    Disaster Strikes    O n January 16, 1939, the north side    of the City Hall wall crumbled.    The afternoon newspaper reported,    “ Five workmen narrowly escaped death    about two o’clock this afternoon when    the north front wing of the old city hall    building collapsed. With a roar that    could be heard for several blocks, a    section about 40 feet high and 30 feet    wide suddenly crumbled and sent bricks    hurtling over the north driveway.”    With City Hall unsafe, there was    a movement to tear the grand old    building down. Engineers from across the state declared    that it was too far- gone to repair, but a group of citizens led    by developer Hugh MacRae questioned their findings.    They felt that the building was an important component    of the city’s history and that it had been built with great    skill in 1856. A new building was refused and City Hall    underwent massive renovations.    Steel beams were added to the building. The library’s    wooden floor was replaced by cement, and Thalian Hall    was given a gracious    facelift. In December    1940, the library moved    back into City Hall with    all new steel shelving.    It remained there for    another sixteen years.    At the end of 1941,    attention turned to a    new topic as the United States entered World War II.

Around the same time that    the library returned to North Third Street, everyone in    southeastern North    Carolina was talking    about the announcement    of an army base to be    constructed 30 miles    north of Wilmington at    Holly Ridge.    In April 1941, the    installation was named    Camp Davis to honor North Carolina native Major General    Richmond Pearson Davis who had served admirably in    World War I. Built in five months    and ten days, Camp Davis became    one of the Army’s largest Antiaircraft    Artillery Training Centers during    World War II. By August 1941,    20,000 troops were stationed there.    Throughout the war, Camp Davis    soldiers fled to Wilmington during    their free time. Both the black and white USO clubs as well    as local movie theaters, dance halls and places of worship    were brimming with servicemen. Residents opened their    homes to the soldiers and sailors. The beaches provided    another major attraction.    Books for the Armed Forces    I n April 1941, the library Board of Trustees began the    Camp Davis library project. They offered 1,000 books    from the Wilmington Public Library as a nucleus for a    camp library. They also encouraged the community to    share leisure time materials with the soldiers. Within a    month, the library had collected hundreds of magazines,    games and playing cards.    Victory Book Week, a nationwide campaign to provide    ten million books for the armed forces, was held during    the last week of January 1942. Sponsored by the American    Library Association, the Red Cross and the USO, libraries    across the country became depositories for every good book    that could be spared. The Wilmington    Morning Star reported “ Don’t use this    merely as an opportunity to be rid of    trash, but dig up some books of the    kind that you think you might like    to read yourself if you were a soldier.    Even your spare books can help with    the war!”    Although Wilmingtonians had    been contributing to local military    libraries for the past year, the Victory    Campaign netted another 3,000 volumes which were    distributed to the armed forces stationed throughout the    world.    A Booming Economy    W orld War II transformed Wilmington from a sluggish    railroad town still struggling to recover from the    Great Depression into an economic    boomtown.    Peak construction at Camp Davis    employed 21,000 workers. Others    found employment at the North    Carolina Shipbuilding Company.    The first contract called for 25    Liberty ships    and by March 1941, 1,000 men    and women were working at the    yard. The first vessel launched was    the Zebulon Vance on December    6, 1941. In all, 243 ships were    built in the shipyard. During peak    production the shipyard employed    as many as 4,500 men and women per shift. In March    1943, total employment reached 21,000.    The shipyard employed large numbers of African-    American workers who were attracted by good wages. Also,    there were two African- American units stationed at Camp    Davis. In order to keep up with the increase in new readers,    the Negro Branch of the Wilmington Public Library moved    to a new location on Red Cross Street in February 1942.    Both the city and county increased funding for the library,    and librarian Emily Shober was able to purchase 500 new    books.

Although the    bookmobile was operated    chiefly as a war recreation    project, all persons were    welcome to use the library.    Another war recreation    project, a 5,000 book    library, was opened at the    Lake Forest war housing    project.    Throughout the war,    library circulation and    registration fluctuated,    depending on troop levels.    Plentiful employment    also kept residents from    visiting the city library in person. The war itself created    the necessity of getting books to the readers rather than    the other way around. War workers as well as servicemen    and their families lived throughout the county.    The bookmobile stopped in Wrightsboro; Castle    Hayne; Middle Sound; Greenville Sound; Winter Park;    Wrightsville Sound; Wrightsville Beach; Carolina Beach;    Kure Beach; the shipyard trailer camp; Maffitt Village;    Lake Forest; and Hillcrest, as well as several stops within    the city limits. When the WPA terminated control of the    bookmobile in 1943, the county commissioners agreed to    supplement funds provided by the city and the Housing    Authority to keep the service going. The bookmobile was    purchased from the Federal government for $ 200.    From the time the Wilmington Public Library took    over complete management of the bookmobile and the    Lake Forest Library, total circulation soared. During the    busiest year on record, June 1943 to June 1944, 167,216    books were checked out.    The Library Comes to Carolina Beach    B y 1943, bookmobile service had become so popular    at Carolina Beach that the Woman’s Club asked    the library Board    of Trustees for    help starting their    own library. The    Wilmington Public    Library offered them    500 books, with    the understanding    that the club would    fund reading rooms    and a librarian. The    Carolina Beach Library became a reality in 1950.    Searching for a Permanent Home    B y the end of World War II, the Wilmington Public    Library was one of the busiest public libraries in the    state. The city and county appropriations totaled about    $ 11,000 per year, and state aid added another $ 1,800.    In March 1946, the mayor asked the library Board of    Trustees to look into moving the library out of City Hall. For    many years, the city    fathers had wanted    to expand their    operations into the    library rooms, and    it was well- known    that the library had    outgrown its space.    With the death    of Miss Ellen Bellamy, the mayor thought that the board    should consider a move to the Bellamy Mansion.    In the late 1940s, the majority of Wilmington residents    still lived and worked downtown. The Tide Water Power    Company closed streetcar service in 1939, and bus service    was inaugurated. Most city dwellers could still walk or take    public transportation to the library. The bookmobile was    providing adequate service to outlying suburbs and rural    areas of the county.    The Bellamy Mansion was thought to be a suitable    location for a new library facility, and the 50 heirs to the    property were willing to permit acquisition if the facility    were to be known as the “ Bellamy Public Library.” Many    also felt that the historic building could accommodate    the county museum that was housed in the New Hanover    County Court House    annex.    Louis J. Poisson, a    member of the library    Board of Trustees, was    appointed to chair a    committee of citizens    to study the possibility    of renovating the    Bellamy Mansion    as a library- museum    or library and arts    center. He reported back to the mayor that: the old    building was not suitable for a library; renovations would    be too costly; and the project would destroy the character    of the mansion. The Wilmington Public Library remained    in City Hall for 10 more years.    Change on the Horizon    A t the end of the 1940s, no one anticipated the    impending despair associated with the removal of the    headquarters of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad from    Wilmington to Jacksonville, Florida.

In anticipation of the event, the library    purchased many new juvenile books about    how children live in foreign lands.    In January 1950, the library sent    500 books to the town of Carolina Beach to assist in the    formation of a town    library. In return,    the town promised    to provide a    library room and be    responsible for funding    library personnel and supplies. Organized by the Woman’s    Club of Carolina Beach, the library    was first located in the old Town Hall    and Fire Station.    Miss Emma Retires    M rs. Emma Woodward MacMillan,    hired as Chief Librarian in 1924,    retired in 1951. During her tenure, the library grew from    10,168 volumes to 53,318. Circulation increased from    29,430 to 124,066, and income from fines and rentals rose    from $ 437 to $ 2,587. In regard to the bookmobile service    she helped inaugurate, Mrs. MacMillan said “ It’s the finest    thing we’ve ever done; the library ought to    be proud of it.”    She built the library’s North Carolina    Collection, which is considered one of    the finest in the South. Mrs. MacMillan    continued to pursue her passion for local    history during her reitrement, publishing    Wilmington’s Vanished Homes and Buildings in 1966.    Born in Wilmington in the 1890s, she died in her    hometown in 1975.    A Welcome Gift    T he City Fathers’ decades- long quest to find a better    location for the library ended when the Wilmington    Light Infantry offered to deed 709 Market Street to the    community. The WLI was organized in 1853 as a militia    company. Later it became a military reserve unit associated    with the National Guard. In 1892, they purchased the    former John A. Taylor house built about 1846 for the    former New York businessman who moved to Wilmington    and invested in steamboats and railroads. The building’s    classical features took on a martial appearance when    the WLI placed cannons on the roof and in front of    the building. By the 1950s, membership in the WLI was    waning. Two years before the organization’s centennial    and the disbanding that followed, the WLI transferred    ownership to the city, asking only that a portion of the    basement be retained for clubrooms until the last of its    members died.    Although the building held    potential for a library, it was    too small in its existing state.    The Wilmington Public Library    moved into City Hall in 1906    with 4,000 books to serve a population of less than 25,000    people. By 1951, the library contained 56,000 books for    65,000 people.    In 1954, the city held a bond referendum to renovate    the WLI building and construct an addition. The bond for    $ 120,000 was approved on November 2, 1954.    Changes in Leadership    M eanwhile, Mrs. Mildred Harper of Fredericksburg,    Virginia, replaced Mrs. MacMillan on July 1, 1952.    Mrs. Harper was present for the    renovations of the WLI building but    resigned her post on March 25, 1956,    before the move to the new library    location. While Mrs. Harper only    lasted a few years in her job, she left a    remarkable legacy by hiring Katherine    Howell as assistant librarian. In 1954, both Hurricane Hazel    and Katherine Howell blew into Wilmington. The storm    moved on and Miss Howell stayed.    The joy and burden of moving the    library from City Hall to the new building    fell to her as acting Head Librarian. The    Library Board of Trustees witnessed her    success and decided they need not look    any further for Mrs. Harper’s replacement.    The Board members walked over to her    house and offered her the job the same morning.    “ I had just gotten out of the bath and was in my    bathrobe with hair in curlers when I heard someone at the    door,” Miss Howell said. “ When I opened the door, to my    shock and surprise, there stood the Library Board. They    offered me the job as Head Librarian and I accepted.” It    was a good fit and she remained on the job for 28 years.    The Big Move    R enovation of the WLI building began in 1955. The    basement provided a special workroom for county    bookmobile staff and storage for bound newspapers. The    first floor housed a reference book room, a North Carolina    Collection room and a reading room, as well as checkout    facilities and staff offices. Half of the second floor was    renovated for children’s services; the other half was left    to showcase the library’s growing music collection and    Part VI    1950s    Wilmington Light Infantry    Katherine Howell    1958    Emma Woodward    MacMillan    Young Wings 1950    First Carolina Beach Library",2008-08,,,,,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/972,972,973.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/973.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two modern wings    were added to the rear of the building for up- to- date steel    book stacks.    The Wilmington Light Infantry Memorial Library    was dedicated on July 16, 1956. Mayor Dan D. Cameron    presided over the ceremony in which the Rev. B. Frank    Hall, guest speaker and library supporter,    praised what he called Wilmington’s new    “ center of culture.” Mrs. Andrew    J. Howell, library founder, former    member of the Board of Trustees    and long- time patron, snipped    the ceremonial red ribbon.    According to the newspaper, “ the    ceremony at the renovated and    enlarged building was attended by city leaders and many    book- lovers.”    Meanwhile, the Wilmington Colored Library took a    bold step in 1955 when it moved into a new building in    the 600 block of Red Cross Street, a building constructed    by Drs. Hubert A. Eaton and    Daniel C. Roane. Both men    were active in public affairs    and big supporters of the    library. Miss Esther Shober    retired as head of the library.    During the decade, she was followed by Mrs. Martha    Boone, Miss Telfair and Miss Cotton.    A Busy Time    D uring the second half of the decade, the Wilmington    Public Library became involved in many projects    including: participation in a statewide    interlibrary loan program; sending books    to the Medical Auxiliary for distribution    at local hospitals; helping the fledgling    Wilmington College organize its library;    and the microfilming of the library’s vast    collection of bound newspapers dating    back to 1800. In addition, the Wilmington Art Association    held exhibitions on the WLI Memorial Library’s second    floor; a new bookmobile was purchased; and a new- fangled    book return box was placed along Market Street so patrons    could drive up and return books any time.    In 1957, Miss Howell hired the library’s first professional    children’s librarian. Miss Emily Boyce began weekly story    hours, started a summer reading program and delighted    youngsters with her creative bulletin boards, bookmarks    and storytelling.    By August, however, the children, library staff and    library patrons were sweltering. The bond referendum    paid for the renovations but not for air- conditioning. After    the first full summer in the facility, it was apparent that    without air- conditioning the building was suitable for    neither reader nor book.    Trouble Brewing    B y 1958, area leaders were grappling with the impending    move of the headquarters of the Atlantic Coast Line    Railroad to Jacksonville, Florida. Wilmington had been a    railroad town since 1840. By the mid- twentieth century,    a majority of Wilmingtonians either directly or indirectly    depended on the railroad for their livelihood. The town    had been in shock since December 10, 1955, ( Black    Thursday) when the Coast Line announced its plan to    leave Wilmington.    Fortunately for the library, the WLI building had    been secured and the renovation bond approved before    the fateful announcement was made. The area’s economic    future was unstable when the New Hanover County    Commissioners stunned the community by removing all    library appropriations from their proposed 1958- 1959    budget. The news came with no warning. The Library    Board and City Council were furious.    Controversy and Compromise    F or many years the county had provided one- third of    the library budget. In return, the library operated the    bookmobile which made 74 stops in two- week intervals    throughout the unincorporated areas of the county and    assisted in funding the Carolina Beach Library. The    Library Board also pointed out that one- third of the    circulation at the WLI and Red Cross Street libraries was    to residents of the county living beyond the city limits. The    County Commissioners replied that in order to balance    their budget they had to cut costs and that taking an ax to    library appropriations was a necessary blow.    A battle royal ensued. Civic clubs presented petitions,    and bibliophiles wrote letters to    the editor while The Morning Star    chastised the commissioners.    Finally, the City Council weighed    in, saying if the county discontinued    their share of the funding, they had    no recourse but to stop bookmobile    service and deny county residents    use of the library. While the Library    Board was meeting to authorize a    recall of all library cards belonging    to persons residing outside the city,    the stalemate was broken. The commissioners agreed to    provide all but $ 5,000 of their normal appropriation. They    said the $ 5,000 was slated to help pay to air- condition the    WLI library building.

African- American students from Williston High School    who asked for Wilmington Light Infantry Memorial Library    privileges were referred to the    City Manager. In January    1960 three students met with    Manager James R. Benson.    He told them that they should    request books from the    Wilmington Public Library    through the Wilmington    Colored Library, reinforcing    a policy that had been in place since a group of Williston    students asked for library cards in 1959.    Although criticized as troublemakers by community    and authorities during this era of unrest, the students    continued to ask peacefully to use the Market Street    library. In September 1961 they were allowed to use the    library on Tuesday afternoons from    5: 30 to 6: 30 to do their homework;    they were informed, however, that    official integration had to be approved    by the City Council.    Integration at Last    O n October 16, 1962, the City Council voted to begin    integrated services immediately. Notification had    been received that state aid funds would be cut off if a    resolution making the change were not adopted.    The headline in the October 20, 1960, Wilmington    Journal read Race Bars Drop at Local Library. The    accompanying article thanked Burdell Harvey and Leo    Shepard, local NAACP officials and civic workers, for    helping to knock down another racial barrier.    Within three months, library cards    had been registered to 44 African-    American taxpayers.    In July 1963 the city council    combined the budgets of the Wilmington    Public Library and the Wilmington    Colored Library. The Red Cross Street    library became a branch library, and    bookmobile services were extended to    African- Americans.    The two library boards were    combined, with Professor F. J. Rogers and George Norman    representing the African- American community.    New Faces    I n 1960 the WLI building was finally air- conditioned in    time for the season, and Miss Anne    Green was hired as    children’s librarian.    Miss Green had    previously worked for a    New York publisher and    was scheduled to have    her first children’s    book published the    following spring.    To Race Again, the    story of a once    famous horse farm    and the adventures    of two boys trying    to solve the mystery    of a missing mare, was aimed at nine to twelve year old    readers.    Both Green and the book were instant success    stories in Wilmington. The children’s    department found unprecedented    popularity under her charge. In 1962    The Valley Cup, her second equestrian    theme book, was published. When    asked why both the main characters    in her novels were boys, she explained    that she noticed that “ girls will read a book on a subject    that they are interested in, regardless of the sex of the    character. Boys almost never take home a book with even a    picture of a girl on the jacket.”    Miss Green, who remained in her position until 1967,    wrote one more book— Good- Bye Gray Lady.    In 1965 Librarian Katherine Howell hired the first    extension services librarian. The idea for outreach programs    became popular during President Lyndon Johnson’s push    for a Great Society. Extension librarians took the books    to people who could not ordinarily get to the library.    The program focused on    the young and the elderly.    Lucy Parker, who was hired    in 1970, spent her career    working in this beloved    community service.    In 1967, Joan Cobbs    ( longtime library employee,    Joan Coco) became the first    African- American hired    to work in the WLI library.

Times A- Changing    T he sixties brought many technical advances to library    services. The library purchased its first coin- operated    photocopier and microfilm reader. The library already    offered record albums for checkout. Now filmstrips,    as well as 16- and 8- millimeter films, were added to the    audiovisual fare. Both the city and the county began to    flirt with the idea of using computers to simplify tasks.    Librarians dreamed of computerized catalogs and check-out    systems.    By the mid- sixties, the WLI library    was already critically out of space. The    Wilmington Morning Star reported that    “ as the largest educational agency in    the community, the library needs your    attention and consideration. Known    as the ‘ People’s University’ with no    scholastic requirements other than the    ability to read, is it to continue to fall    short of your requests for service?”    Library services continued to grow with    the community, but space was at a standstill. It    took sixteen more years of cramped quarters    before a new facility became a reality.    In 1966 Mrs. Cotton retired as head    librarian at the Red Cross branch library.    Vertisha Riggins, graduate of Atlanta    University Library School, replaced her.    During her    tenure, she promoted    African- American history    through collections and    programming. Her weekly    American history programs,    “ Great Decisions,” were    popular with members of    both races.    In 1968, the library acquired a new bookmobile.    New Building for Carolina Beach    T he Carolina Beach Library moved into a new building    in September 1970. Previously, the beach library had    been housed in the Town Hall and a two- story wooden    building.    Funds for this    community effort to obtain    a modern library came from    donations of individuals    and organizations, benefits    and budget appropriations    from the Carolina Beach Town Council. Many locals    provided labor, landscaping and construction materials.    Mrs. Barbara Russell was chairman of the building    committee, which was fundraising until the last minute in    order to make the building ready to receive 2,500 books.    Reaching Out    A first floor deposit library was opened in 1973 at    Solomon Towers, an 11- story building designed to    house low- income retirees. The book- room was supplied by    extension librarians and operated by volunteers who lived    in the building.    Eighth Street Center, a government- funded community    center, was opened the same year. The center included a    neighborhood library. Linda Lewis,    who became a long- time library    employee, was hired to manage the    library.    The next year the library    purchased a cargo van for the    extension department. The    van allowed library staff to    bring traveling story times    to daycare centers, provide    programming to nursing    homes and deliver more    books than ever.    More Trouble Ahead    I n July 1975 New Hanover    County began constructing    the new Law Enforcement    Center adjacent to the library’s    rear parking lot.    As the construction crew    began pounding the pilings    into the ground, the library    parking lot began to crack.    Shortly thereafter, the    WLI building began to split.    The rear addition added in    1956 began to separate from    the main building.

As    crews began pounding    steel sheeting into the    ground in preparation    for excavation, cracks    began appearing in the    library. City workers helped ease the situation by placing    duct tape over the cracks.    Two months later, vibrations from pile- driving    accelerated the cracking, and    construction halted while engineers    assessed the problem. Steel supports    were installed. Except for one week,    the library remained open; staff shifted    all books and office furniture from the    rear to the front of the building.    Library Condition Makes Headlines    C ommunity outrage about    conditions at the public    library began to simmer in April    1976 when Paul Jennewein of    the Star- News reported the plight    of the library in his column.    Warren Stiles, a frequent library    patron, took up the cause with    several letters to the editor. In    the meantime, the library had    to move into temporary quarters    at the old Acme Building on the    northeast corner of Front and    Chestnut streets. Book circulation    plummeted to half its usual    numbers.    The library controversy    changed the political milieu    of New Hanover County. The city and county began in    earnest to talk about consolidation beginning with services    such as the library.    Friends Forever    A n enduring legacy of the deplorable inadequacy of    the library building was the formation of the New    Hanover Friends of the Public Library. The Junior League    was instrumental in the organization of an advocate group    for better library services. Reminiscent of the Sorosis Club,    a women’s organization that pushed for a public library in    1906, the Junior League reached out to all segments of the    community for help.    The library Friends held their first meeting on June 30,    1976. Martha T. Daughtry, Gorda Singletary and Harriet    Somberg were responsible for organizing the meeting. Ann    Wilkerson served as the first president.    Armed with a statistical summary of needs and    community support, the Friends endeavored to place the    library under county government control and lobbied for    funding for a new building.    Many of the organizing Friends became active members    of the Library Advisory Board and are credited with    subsequent good library service in New Hanover County.    Library Advisory Board    T he first meeting of the New Hanover County Public    Library Advisory Board was held on    September 22, 1977.    Dr. James D. Hundley    was elected chair. Their    goals were ambitious:    secure funding from    the county for a new    building; hire a library    design consultant and architect; advocate    the relocation of the Red Cross Branch Library to the    suburbs; and bring the Carolina Beach Library into the    county system.    Where to Build?    A fter New Hanover County set aside $ 2.6 million    for a new library, the Advisory Board and County    Commissioners tackled one of the most controversial    tasks: where to put the new facility. One faction lobbied    for a brand new building in a central county location    accessible to the majority of county residents. The other    faction wanted the library to remain downtown, where the    majority of countywide employees still worked.    The matter was settled when the former Belk- Beery    department store, located at 201 Chestnut Street, was made    available for purchase for $ 500,000; the city promised to    provide $ 300,000 if the library remained downtown. Hoyt    Galvin of Charlotte was hired as library design consultant    and John Jefferies as architect.    Grand Re- Opening    T he 3- story building, with $ 3 million worth of    renovations, had been transformed into a modern    library with plenty of space to grow when it opened on    March 9, 1981. During their first meeting in the new    library, the Board set a goal of increasing the book budget    $ 100,000 to meet state standards.

In April 1980 there were    248 new registrations. In April 1981 there were 835!    Formal Dedication    O n May 15, 1981,    Main Library was    dedicated. Herbert    Mitgang of the New    York Times was the    featured speaker. He    spoke about intellectual    freedom and the fact    that libraries, historically the most democratic of American    institutions, provide access to information to all citizens.    New Leadership    L ibrary Director Katherine Howell retired on August 1,    1982. Early in her career she was in charge during the    library’s move from City Hall to 409 Market Street, and    she wanted to end her career having moved the library to    201 Chestnut. After 27 years and nine    months of service she said, “ I’m happy    to finally use the library as a patron    and tackle my neglected reading list.”    The Library Advisory Board    wasted no time in hiring a new director    to take her place. David Paynter, who    had worked at public libraries in    Fairfax, Virginia, and Florence, South    Carolina, began work the same month.    His immediate charge was to facilitate    the choice of an automated library system and open a new    branch library.    The Information Age    D iscussions about a computerized library system    began in the late 1970s with a move to a Computer    Output Microfilm catalog. This machine- readable catalog    required all library collections to be    entered into a database. Staff began    inputting data while the Belk- Beery    building was being renovated.    The conversion process was    completed in 1983; in 1986 the    Brodart LePac, a computer catalog, replaced the old    microfilm and card catalogs.    NHCPL Branches Out    O ne of the Library Advisory Board’s initial goals was    accomplished when the Carolina Beach Library    became a county branch library in 1979.    Because the Red Cross Street branch was located only    seven blocks from the new Main Library, usage there began    to drop dramatically. It was closed when the College Square    Branch opened in April 1983.    Located in a shopping    center on South College Road,    the new branch circulated    more books in two days than    in an average month at    the old branch library.    The same year,    a whopping 1,500    children signed up for    Summer Reading Club, which included registrations at    both Main Library and the new branch.    80s Happenings    • Cinema Night at the library brought in scores of movie    lovers    • The library started a circulating foreign language    collection    • Microcomputers for public use became available    • Hurricane Diana brought down the Carolina Beach water    tower and sent water rushing into the branch library    • The courthouse law library was placed under the county    library system    • Hollywood came to Wilmington, and DEG Studios began    using discarded library books and wooden card catalogs    for movie props while casting calls and auditions were held    in the library’s meeting rooms    • Gorda Singletary, Library Advisory Board member, was    named 1987 North Carolina Library Trustee of the Year    • New Hanover County placed a No Smoking ban in all    county buildings    • The first FAX machine was installed    • Bruce Brooks, native of Wilmington and Newbery Award    winning author, spoke to a large crowd of adoring young    adults in 1989    • A successful series of family history programs led to the    formation of the Old New Hanover Genealogical Society    • Scuttlebutt, the library’s longtime newsletter, began    publication    • The first compact disk music    collection was purchased    Troubles Ahead    A t the end of the decade, the    Children’s Department was    increasingly being asked to defend    the placement of certain books in    its collection.

New    Hanover County became one of the fastest    growing areas in the state and nation.    Retirees found the climate, beautiful    beaches, good medical facilities and a growing University    of North Carolina at Wilmington very attractive. They    also considered good library services a welcome draw to    the area. In 1991, the library checked out as many books in    four months as it did during the entire year of 1987.    Building a Park    T he library’s goal of opening branches in the growing    areas of southern and northeast    New Hanover County was put on    hold as a more urgent problem was    addressed— the planned construction    of a gas station and convenience store    next to the entrance of Main Library.    Concerned library aficionados, as    well as downtown businesses and residents, formed the    Urban Park Downtown Advisory Committee. County    Commissioners were amenable to buying the property for    a park if the group could raise $ 150,000 to help in the    effort.    In February 1993, grading began on the park when    Carolina Savings Bank    and Branch Banking &    Trust Company donated    $ 100,000 to the cause.    Al Frega’s sculpture,    The Chalice, was chosen for the Carolina Courtyard water    feature.    The park and urban sculpture were welcome additions    to intercity revitalization. The park also allowed the library    to move programming outside. Guest storytellers, book    signings, volunteer luncheons, music in the park and other    happenings became common.    Myrtle Grove Library    M eanwhile, in 1991, John Sawyer was chosen as    architect for the Myrtle Grove Branch Library, which    would be located at Monkey Junction to serve the southern    end of the county. A state/ federal grant for $ 231,238 helped    move the project forward. Clancy & Theys Construction    Company was awarded the contract in May 1992.    The Myrtle Grove    Branch Library was    dedicated on September    2, 1993. The new branch    was an instant success,    especially with children.    Nearby residents flocked to the library for popular reading    and for children’s story times. Statistics show the New    Hanover Public Library system grew exponentially.    Plaza East Branch Opens    F or many years there had been talk of a branch in the    Wrightsville Beach area of the county as well. Landfall,    an enormous gated community, began development    nearby in the mid- 1980s and Porters Neck, another nearby    residential community, was expanding. By the 1990s the    rapidly growing population wanted branch library services.    On February 7, 2003, the Plaza East Library, an urban    branch in a shopping center with the    same name, was dedicated; and the    College Square Branch was closed.    An unfortunate but necessary    result of the new branch was the    termination of bookmobile services.    It was obvious that New Hanover    County was becoming too urban for the traditionally rural    service. The library’s mobile outreach, however, continued    to serve hundreds of homebound    residents.    In all, four lasting changes    in the library system took place    in 1993: Carolina Courtyard    became a reality, the Plaza East    and Myrtle Grove branch libraries    opened, and bookmobile service    ended.    A Time of Growth    D uring the mid- 90s, demand for library services    grew by leaps and bounds. In 1995, 3,000 children    participated in the Summer Reading Program. Both adult    and children’s programming reached all time high turnouts.    “ War & Remembrance,” “ The 21st Century” and the “ Let’s    Talk About It” series, as well as “ The Civil War” and other    local history weekly programs, were very popular.

Technology Moves Forward    W hile county residents were visiting their library    more than ever, technological advances gave them    new reasons to come. Internet access became available in    1997 and the next year, NC LIVE, a statewide licensing    of a myriad of informational databases, went online. The    same year, the library’s catalog became available through    the library webpage.    Within a few years, the library was offering    downloadable electronic books ( e- books) and music    through its catalog and webpage.    Smart Start    N orth Carolina’s Smart Start program and the New    Hanover County Partnership for Children provided    funding to extend storytelling services to child daycare    centers. Smart Start caused    an increase in the children’s    department’s juvenile programming    from 2,100 participants in 1996 to    5,000 participants in 1997.    Local History Preserved    I n 1998, the Friends of the Library and the library’s local    history room published Strength Through Struggle : The    Chronological and Historical Record of the    African- American Community in Wilmington,    North Carolina, 1865- 1950. About the same    time, the library posted over 1,300 local    history photographs from the Robert M.    Fales Collection online, one of the first    large digital projects in the state.    Continued Expansion    B y the end of the 1990s, the Plaza East Branch Library    could not sustain the demand for services in the    northeast region of the county. The Northeast Library    Action Committee was    formed to raise awareness    and funds for a full- service    regional library branch in that part of the county. In    October 1997, the county commissioners approved the    purchase of an abandoned supermarket building for a    new library. They asked the community to contribute $ 1    million toward the effort.    While Smith Gage Architects drew renovation plans    for the Northeast Regional Library project, fundraising    was long and arduous. In February 2000, goals were met    and construction began. The grand opening, attended by    400 enthusiastic supporters, was held on September 29.    The library, with its spacious bookroom, computer lab,    meeting rooms and original artwork was a dream come    true for area residents. At the same time, the Carolina    Beach Library underwent much needed renovations.    Crisis Averted    I n the meantime, the city informed the county that they    had to build a parking deck before they could construct    a new county courthouse annex. The site chosen for the    deck was the Main Library’s parking lot. With plans in    hand, the Library Advisory Board addressed the loss of    the parking lot with a proposal to renovate all three floors    of the Main Library building. When the library opened    in 1981, it had been predicted that expansion would be    necessary in 25 years. It was time, and the Library Advisory    Board pointed out that the cost of renovations would be    cheaper if done simultaneously with the parking deck.    The County Commissioners first agreed to the plan    but changed their minds in the middle of construction.    Mold problems had been found    in the county annex building    and the commissioners voted    to move employees from that    building to the library’s third    floor. A firestorm of concern    from library supporters ensued,    and the commissioners found    alternative housing for the annex workers.    Reason to Celebrate    O n June 5, 2003, an open house and celebration was    held at the renovated Main Library. Nicholas Kristof,    New York Times columnist, was the keynote speaker. Third    floor offices and meeting rooms, an expanded North    Carolina Room, Children’s Room and Audiovisual Room    were featured, as well as updated first floor amenities. A    new addition was the Consumer Health Library which    had been moved from the New Hanover Regional Medical    Center to the public library.    Thankfully, Some Things Never Change    D uring the latter part of the 20th century and early part    of the 21st century, library technologies, buildings    and services have grown along with the region’s expanding    population. Through it all, the library’s primary objective—    READ— has been the    same for the past one    hundred years.

From a room in Thalian    Hall, the library has    expanded to a major downtown facility, three branches,    and a law library served by a 50- member staff .    The dramatic increase in the number and size of    library buildings is only one part of the    library’s growth. In addition:    • We now have over 100,000 registered    borrowers, which is more than three    times the number of people living in    New Hanover County one hundred    years ago.    • In 1906, the library opened with a    collection of 1,700 books; the library    now has over    400,000 items in its    collection.    • Circulation of    library books in our    first decade averaged    about 25,000 items a    year. Today the library annually circulates over one million    books and audiovisual materials.    • In 2006, 2,000 visitors daily walk through library    facilities— a ten- fold increase from 1906.    • Today, library staff answer over 600,000 questions each    year— a statistic not deemed important enough to track in    1906.    • Finally, today’s public library provides a    wealth of services not even imagined 100    years ago. Audiobooks, electronic journals,    e- books, consumer health information,    grant resources, digital    photographs, Internet    access, etc., are all part    of a century of library    progress.    Supporting this growth has been a significant increase    in the library’s budget. In 1906, the City of Wilmington    appropriated $ 1,200 to fund the operation of the library. In    2006, New Hanover County appropriates over $ 3,500,000    including state and federal funds. On a per capita basis,    the cost to operate our library system is less than that of    most libraries in North Carolina.    An Increasingly Digital World    H aving looked back at the last one hundred years, one    inevitably begins to think about the next hundred    years. Currently, library services are arranged around three    factors: collections, staff, and facilities. This troika will    continue into the future.    Regarding collections, clearly    the digital world will continue its    advance, and all for the good, since    the resources available on the Internet    will continue to enrich all libraries.    This is especially true in the area of    reference collections and journals. In    both of these areas our library has    been able to significantly enhance its    collections at little    cost because of its    association with    NC LIVE, North Carolina’s virtual    library for public and academic    libraries. The future will see increased    funding for initiatives like NC LIVE    which provide an economy of scale while equalizing    resources available to communities statewide— a fact that    is very appealing to those who fund libraries. Audiovisual    departments will also take increasing advantage of the    many Internet options available to libraries to strengthen    their collections.    A Smaller World    W hile print collections may grow at a slower pace,    they will be better tailored to user needs through    the increased sophistication of library computer systems.    Customers will develop user profiles, and libraries    will move from a passive role of holding collections to    promoting the use of specific material to their users based    on self- generated profiles.    We shall also see better    integration of unique library    resources such as our special    collections and catalog within    the worldwide web, and our users    will correspondingly come from    all over the world— not just New    Hanover County. In a global    environment, paradoxically, local    collections will increase in their    importance, as public libraries    become the natural repository for    locally produced materials.

There are very few    places where you can find    such a wonderful mix of    ages and background.    I know from experience    that one of the first    things that newcomers    to Wilmington do is to    get their public library    card— almost as if that act    validates them as members of the community. At any rate    this speaks volumes about the centrality of the public    library in people’s minds.    Library Supporters Lead the Way    A s we conclude our centennial year, I would be remiss    if I did not remark upon the many people who have    both used their public library and supported their public    library in so many ways.    In reviewing the past one hundred years, one is struck    by how often it is the general public which has taken the    lead in the development of library services. From the    Sorosis Club, which in 1906 advocated the creation of the    Wilmington Public Library,    to the Friends of the Library    in 1976 who organized to    support the creation of the    New Hanover County Public Library, and more recently,    to the Northeast Library Action Committee, which led the    charge for improved branch services, it was our users and    potential users who spearheaded the effort for improved    public library service.    Perhaps their dynamism was based upon a passion for    reading and learning that they could only envision fully    realized in a library. As long as this is the case, the next one    hundred years of library service in New Hanover County    will be as fruitful as the last one hundred.    — David M. Paynter, Library Director    Hanover County has been a leader in this area and will    continue to develop such collections.    Workplace Challenges    L ibrary staff will continue to assist users in research and    in reader advisory. Their skills will help people make    better sense out of the amazing complexity and variety of    information resources now available.    Library staff will need to be well-educated,    technologically adept, and    culturally aware if they are to continue    to provide excellence in customer    service. At the same time, new skills    in marketing, assessment, and training    will need to be developed.    Self- service applications will allow    library staff to spend less time on    support activities and more time in    providing customer assistance.    Children Still Come First    O ne area in which public libraries will find increasing    recognition is in their work with young children. It    is increasingly recognized that the most    significant development in mental ability    occurs early in    life.    The exposure to vocabulary and reading    that occurs in children’s programs is    critical in the development    of a child’s literacy skills. Programs such as    our “ Growing Readers” will be expanded    and become mandatory throughout North    Carolina.    Building for the Future    W hile the remote user will become as prevalent as    the person walking into a library, this will not    obviate the need for well- designed    libraries.    Communities have always    been defined in large measure    by the public institutions they    create. A community with an    excellent public library makes a    strong statement on how it values    learning and intellectual pursuits.    Libraries will remain centers for self- education, but    they also will serve an even more fundamental role as a    gathering place for community.

The urgent need of these facilities in filling the requirement's    of well rounded community life is unquestionably recognized by    every progressive minded citizen having the health and educa­tional    welfare of the children and young people of this city at    heart. It is a program that is maintained by every city of any    size and progressiveness throughout the state and i's the only    allotment of city expense directed exclusively to healthful rec­reational    advantages for our children and in providing library    facilities for the advancement of their education as well as for    the pleasure and convenience of older persons.    Without such conveniences, the city of Lenoir would stand    almost alone among the cities of the state in its lack of facilities    to provide healthful, recreational pursuits for its children as    well as public ' library advantages. To discontinue them after    they have become so well established 8: S a part of the life of the    community, would be a backward step that would cast a serious    reflection upon the city as a whole and upon the vision and    judgment of its citizenship.    The City Commissioners are firmly of the opinion that the    people of this community want these advantages to continue    and to be conducted with a well organized program under the    supervision of a commi'.~ sion selected from the citizens of the city    that the recreational facilities may be properly and efficiently    developed and handled to the , best interests of the children and    young people of this community.    It is imperative however, that expenditures for these purposes    be authorized by public vote before they can become a part of    the city operating expenses. Heretofore, they have been paid out    of miscellaneous funds and not included in the regUlar budget    from the tax schedule. Under the law however, these expenses    must be included in the schedule if an organized program under    the proposed commission is to be followed.",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1009,1009,1010.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1010.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The elec­tion    is NOT for the purpose of increasing the city tax rate as has    been grossly and purposely misrepresented.    The City Commissioners individually are among the largest    tax payers- in the city. They are long established business. and    professional men who are endeavoring to give the city a clean    and efficient business administration. They were elected for that    purpose and have endeavored to serve the people in a manner    becoming to their records as successful business and professional    men and as loyal citizens of this community.    NO INCREASE IN TAXES    If the special levies are authorized by the people, the levies will    be incorporated into the PRESENT tax rate of $ 1.20 per $ 100 pro­perty    valuation.    In the recreation and library matter the City Commissioners    are very properly seeking to place these expenditures upon a    sound and systematic basis as part of the regularly authorized    expense of the city government, instead of under the present sys­tem    with its limitations and uncertainties due to a recent deci­sion    of the Attorney General of the State.    This the commission proposes to do without increasing the    overall tax rate. They have given this assurance frankly and    candidly and are entitled to the confidence of the citizenship    irrespective of the chronic misrepresentations of a reactionist    who thrives upon sensationalism and distortion of facts.    No city of comparable size in North Carolina has such a fine    up- town park as does Lenoir. It is well equipped with playground    devices, a wading pool, two tennis courts, a shuffleboard court,    numerous benches, and other facilities. During the past Summer    it was used extensively by children and adults, and a well- round­ed    program was carried out under supervision of trained per­sonnel.    The Recreation program attracted nearly 39,640 persons dur­ing    the past year. Six playgrounds were in operation last Sum­mer.    These were Major Harper Park, West Lenoir School, East    Lenoir School, Central High School, Wilson Playground, and    Freedman School. The Recreation Center was open during the    Fall, Winter and Spring, under supervision of capable directors.",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1010,1010,1011.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1011.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HOEY    The name of Jacob S. Mauney ranks high as an out- standing    and up- standing businessman and citizen in the history of Cleve��land    County and all this section of North Carolina.    Jointly with his brother, the lateW. A. Mauney, he became    a pioneer merchant and manufacturer, and though his intelligent    and untiring efforts laid a broad foundation for a great career in    his chosen lines of activity, and incidentally established himself as •    a wise and public- spirited citizen, dedicated to the advancement of    his community and county. He was one of the real builders of    Kings l\ 10untain. While building material success for himself    he was successful in building a character of granite like quality    which continues to endure long after his departure from the sphere    of his earthly activity.    Mr. Mauney was blessed with a wife who was a real life    companion and exemplified the finest traits of womanly graces and    virtues and contributed her full quota to his life of service and    achievement.    This ideal couple were blessed with a fine family of children    and it is not surprising that they have honored the memory of    their beloved parents by making a great contribution to the civic,    cultural and educational life of their loved native city of Kings    Mountain by donating the magnificent rejuvenated Hord resi­dential    property as a Public Library and Teacherage. No gift    could be more appropriate and fitting and none could more nearly    approximate the ideal in honoring this worthy couple of blessed    memory.    I salute the honored memory of Mr. and Mrs. Jacob S. Mauney    and sincerely congratulate the Mauney family upon this generous    expression of their sincere thought and concern for the whole    community.",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2013-05-08,2013-05-08,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1041,1041,1042.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1042.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J. 1. MORGAN, D. D.    Those of us whose privilege it was to have known Mr. Jacob S.    Mauney will remember him as a fine Christian gentleman, and    his wife, Mrs. Juletta Rudisill Mauney, as an equally noble lady    of Christian graces. Theirs was a beautiful life together, and    their inHuence for good has left its impress upon both their family    and their friends, which will live on for generations to come. In    the first place, they believed in God, and in Jesus Christ as their    Saviour, as the sure foundation upon which all lasting worth must    rest. Mr. Mauney was deprived of a college education, by the    War Between the States, in which he was a seventeen- year- olel    volunteer, but he, like his wife, possessed native ability which    enabled him to become a leader in business, and in the rebuilding    of our beloved Southland, upon his return from the battle front    at the close of hostilities.    Mr. and Mrs. Mauney were believers in education, and, in    addition to educating their own children, and the upkeep of their    local schools, they gave liberally for the support of higher Christian    education. This was especially evidenced by them taking a leading    part in the building of Mauney Hall for Girls at Lenoir Rhyne    College at Hickory, N. C. And they were at the same time liberal    in helping to build mission churches, and in the support of all    good causes, both at home and abroad. It is, therefore, quite fitting    and most highly commendable that their children and grand­children    have made possible this beautiful Jacob S. Mauney    Memorial Library and dedicated it to their memory, here in this    fair city which these two highly esteemed citizens helped to build    and beautify.

Mauney was born on April 6th, 1846 near Cherryville in Gaston    County. He was but 15 years old when the War Between the States broke    out. Two years later, when 17, he enlisted in the 72nd Regiment of North    Carolina Troops and served throughout the remainder of the war. His    outfit was first stationed at Wilmington to guard the bridge and ferry.    While there he accomplished the feat of swimming the Cape Fear River at    its widest point, an accomplishment regarded then as unusual.    As a youthful soldier in the Confederate Army he displayed in his first    battle, an engagement at Kinston, the courage which enabled him later    to contend with adverse conditions and win success. A picket had been    shot and the regular stretcher- bearers hesitated to go out of the trenches    to get him. Volunteers were called for and he and two others volunteered    to go out and attempt his rescue. Before they reached their fallen fellow    soldier a rain of bullets from the enemy met them. They had a miraculous    escape, accomplishing the rescue of their co- patriot. A moment after they    had left the spot it was torn to pieces by an exploding bomb.    During the two years or more he was in the Confederate Army Mr.    Mauney was in several engagements and, like all other Confederate    soldiers, saw much hardship and suffering. Returning home at 20, he, like    thousands of other young men of that day, found that they had to start life    at the bottom. For a time he engaged in farming.    On September II, 1873, he married Margaret Juletta Rudisill, a daughter    of John and Mary E. ( Smith) Rudisill, of Lincoln County. Mrs. Margaret    Juletta Mauney was born January 26, 1850. Shortly after their marriage    they located where the town of Kings Mountain now is and Mr. Mauney    with his brother, W. Andrew Mauney, opened a small general merchandise    store. At that time the railroad was being built and he rode a work- train    into Charlotte to purchase the stock of goods.    Shortly after that the railroad was completed through Kings Mountain    and the town began to grow. The Mauney brothers, Jacob and Andrew,    pioneered in practically every line of endeavor in the new town.    Mr. Mauney was among the organizers of the town's first cotton mill,    the Kings Mountain Manufacturing Company, in 1888. Later he was    interested in the organization and building of the Bonnie, Dilling,    Mauney and Sadie mills. Throughout a long and active life Mr. Mauney    was closely identified with the mercantile, banking and manufacturing life    of the town as well as with its religious, civic; and educational growth.",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2013-05-08,2013-05-08,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1044,1044,1045.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1045.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The principal speakers    were Governor- Elect Clyde R. Hoey and Federal Judge E. Y. Webb. Mr.    Webb paid a splendid tribute to Mr. Mauney as a community builder.    He had known him since childhood and extoled his virtues as a business    man and as a citizen of constructive leadership.    Mr. and Mrs. Mauney were charter members of St. Matthews Lutheran    Church. They were loyal and faithful to the Church. While large contrib­utors    to their own church they assisted in the construction of Lutheran    churches in Hendersonville, Shelby and other communities. He was not    only known as the GRAND OLD MAN of Kings Mountain but also of    the North Carolina Synod of the Lutheran Church. He was a large con­tributor    to Lenoir- Rhyne College. He endowed a Jacob Mauney Scholar­ship    Fund which has helped many worthy young people. He was one o[    the chief contributors to the erection of Mauney Hall, a modern, fireproof    home for young women at the college. For over 20 years he was a member    of the Board of Trustees and a loyal supporter of the administration of the    institution.    Mrs. Mauney learned endurance and hardship as a child during the    days of the Civil War and Heconstruction period. She was small of stature    and for many years of frail body but she continued a busy and active life    to the end. She was of indomitable energy and will power, keenly interested    in life, friendly and sociable with all classes and conditions of people,    both white . and black. She had a veritable passion for being helpful to    all who were in need. Her first interest and loyalty was to her church. She    was acquainted with all its work and was a generous contributor to all    causes at home or abroad. She took an active interest in the growth or    the town, in the Public Schools, and in the civic and social betterment of    the community. She was commonly spoken of as "" the best known and    most loved woman of Kings Mountain."" Her death came after a brief    illness at her home January 27th, 1930. She was at that time 80 years of    age and had lived with her husband more than 56 years.    Jacob S. Mauney after his wife's death lived quietly for more than six    years at their home in Kings Mountain on North Piedmont Avenue. His    death came on November 6, 1936.

Yet in this brief period the    Fayetteville area has emerged as a leader in progress,    the third fastest growing city in the southeastern United    States. For the greater Fayetteville area such unusual    growth has meant construction, expansion, modernization    on all fronts in all facets of community life.    The voters of Fayetteville and Cumberland County en­thusiastically    supported planning, financing and construc­tion    of literally dozens of new school buildings, a major    addition to our county hospital facilities that more than    doubled the number of patient beds; a large county    office building; also shared with the State in the con­struction    and operation of a technical institute; and a new    auditorium/ arena along with the assurance and scheduled    construction of a "" jet age"" municipal airport.    With these and other improvements in a progress- minded    community, it's small wonder an industrial giant like    Rohm and Haas and a world- renowned tool manufacturer    like Black and Decker found the mood and pace of the    Fayetteville area to their liking, and settled in our midst.    # .... ~---~ ~    _ .. &lt; t .... ..- .... .,.    ~,. . ... "" .,.    This Reference Area can accommodate only four or five people    before becoming overcrowded.    The Galvin report recognized the basic needs for larger    facilities as did the Library Board in a two- year study    of its own. And both argued for the new central library    in the downtown area.    Acquisition of the old post office site received almost    unanimous support from every segment of the community.    And in due course, the federal government, responding    to the local demand, gave title to this property to the    city of Fayetteville with the provision that it be used    only for library purposes.    In the meantime the Library Board, on the basis of Galvin's    recommendations, had presented the plans for a new    central library building on the site the public supported.    Taking such a big step forward in the direction of an    adequate library system required formidable effort. Pass­age    of the Library Referendum Bond Issue will complete    the cycle of progress in this area and fill an overwhelming    need!    In this decade, too, a new four- year college has emerged    and justified the faith of a community that shared the    privileges of financial sponsorship. And now, caught up    in this exciting tableau of progress, comes the challenge    and the opportunity to move ahead with plans to provide    a library program worthy and able to meet the demands    and the needs of a modern metropolitan area in this    dynamic decade.    STARTLING GAP    The gap between the standards required to serve our    present population of 180,000 and the actual facilities    available at this time is startling:    Standards Required: We Have:    90,000 sq. ft. Space ---------- 29,606 Sq. Ft.    9,000 sq.. ft. Reader Space 3,750 Sq. Ft.    360,000 Books .90,000 Books    300 sq. ft. Research Area . None    1,000 sq. ft. Audio- Visual Area None    Facilities for Educational Programs _ __ None    Certainly, if the gap cannot be closed completely, it should    at least be narrowed to a more tolerable range.    But, apart from the statistics which suggest the ideal    arrangement, it is obvious and clear that a library system    which served a population of 115,000 in 1955 is by no    means adequate to serve a projected population of    200,000 in 1970 - only two years from now.    This inadequacy has concerned the Cumberland County    Library Board over the years as it considered how the    situation could be improved.    In 1964 the library trustees authorized Hoyt Galvin, a    library consultant, to make a complete study of the Cum­berland    County Library System and to make recommenda­tions.    Among the recommendations of Galvin were:    1) That a new central library should be built downtown    2) It should be in the business district    3) The old Post Office site should be acquired    4) A new 50,000 square foot building should be erected    5) Anderson Street site be relinquished to the city    FINANCING    Preliminary plans for the type of building on the cover    indicate a cost of $ 1,300,000; this will be financed as    follows:    1) Anticipated Federal Grant $ 250,000    2) Bond Issue 1,050,000    City authorities estimate that the Bond Issue, if approved,    will mean an increase of 6 to 7c per $ 100 assessed evalu­ation.    For the average taxpayer with an assessed property    evaluation of $ 8000, this would mean less than the price    of one good magazine per month ( 501)! Think of it!    Passage of the Bond Issue will not only mark a tremen­dous    stride toward adequate library facilities to serve all    the people of Cumberland County ... but will add new    dimensions to our attractiveness to industry. Community    planners hqve urged such progress to round out the down­town    district!

A. from 1911 to 1914 dnd from 1920 to 1931    I have been requested to give the history of this association, "" the    short and simple annals"" of a very poor but very brave country library.    Mrs. Wells, of Shortoff, has left a record of its beginnings. It was in    1880 that her sister, Mrs. Hudson, came here in search of health.    Great suffering and death were hers instead; but she was of the heroic    type and "" master of her soul,"" and her thoughts turned to others.    These two sisters "" often spoke of a plan by which good reading matter    might be placed within reach of these little communities,"" and after    Mrs. Hudson's death her friends in the North, especially Dr. E. E.    Hale's society of Boston and the Unitarian church of Worcester, Mass.,    of which she was a member, donated a box of books, mostly bound    and new, as a nucleus for a free library. Mrs. Wells offered the gift to    Highlands as "" the most central and accessible point, only asking that    it should bear the name of the Hudson Library as a loving tribute to    the noble woman in memory of whom the books were contributed.""    From this tiny germ, this box of books, has grown our present library    of over 1500 volumes ( July 4, 1915), and now that we have house room    not only for 1500 but even for 7000 volumes, we may hope for much    more rapid growth in the near future.    So the Hudson Free Library Association was formed, and in 1884    and ' 85 we find it meeting in the schoolhouse at Highlands engaged in    framing a constitution and by- laws, with Mr. S. T. Kelsey, Sr., the    founder of Highlands, as its president. Apparently most of the promi­nent    men of the town were present at these first meetings. It appears    that in the beginning there was quite a ceremony of members marching    up and signing their names "" to the constitution and by- laws,"" and it    is interesting to see some of the old signatures, but this custom was    discontinued later. The following names of members look like the    early history of Highlands, like the old pioneer days :- Mr. Esty, Dr.    Wheeler and Frank S. Sheldon were among the secretaries; other    officers were H. M. Bascom, J. Jay Smith, C. A. Boynton ( the elder    Boynton), James Rideout, Wm. Partridge, Dr. Frost, W. C. Trow­bridge,    Rev. J. E. Fogartie ( the Presbyterian minister, a very devoted    and scholarly man). Charles L. Boynton, the son of C. A.

Historq of the Hudson Librarq Association    was treasurer in 1889 and later secretary, in 1894-' 95. He was afterward    a well known botanist, and one of the collectors for the famous Bilt­more    herbarium. Others were E. Selleck, Mrs. H. P. Selleck, Dr.    O'Farrell, Mrs. Anna M. Aaron, Mrs. Partridge, Mrs. L. E. W. e1ls,    Mrs. E. H. Emnions, the mother ot Mrs. Wells and Mrs. Hudson, S.    T. Kelsex, Jr., Mrs. Kibbee, Augustus Kibbee, Horace G. Kibbee, Mrs.    Reese (, i4l. ura Kibbee).    Early efforts were made for incorporation, but they failed. Mr.    Kelsey continued in office several years, followed in 1889 by Mr. T.    Baxter White, who was president for about 22 years, until 1911. In    the same year Miss Jessie White was elected librarian and the reading    room.. of the Y. M. C. A. was to be used as a place for keeping the    books, and there was another attempt at incorporation, securing a    charter. In 1894 there were held in the schoolhouse general meetings,    largely attended by those interested in the library, both residents and    visitors. It was decided that this association was in a disorganized    condition, and these meetings were a rally, a re- birth of the society.    There was talk of a union of all the Highlands societies, but, fortunate­ly,    this plan fell through. At that time the library was contained with­in    an old- fashioned closed bookcase Of six shelves which stood in a    corner of the large school room. Everybody go~ busy, the constitution    was revised, which is always the first thing Americans do after a    cataclysm, many new members ( and their fees) were obtained, another    effort shortly successful was made to incorporate, so that the associa­tion    could own real estate,' and there was talk of opening a reading    room or boys' c. lub in connection with the library. They tried to get    a room of the Masonic Lodge, but the rent, $ 58.00 a year, with an    estimate of possibly $ 80.00 to furnish, was prohibitory, so that later the    offer of the schoolhouse wing as a reading room was gladly accepted,    and a Boys' Club was started and kept up that winter. It is amusing    to see the way in which the spirit of cooperation manifested itself at    this time; it was in a meeting at Oak Hall; I remember that it was    done with much laughter, jesting and good fellowship; the school com­mittee    gave tl: e room, Mr. Harbison loaned the stove, which was    cracked a little on one side, so Mr. Boynton had it repaired and set    up, Mr. White helping to move it; Mr. J. Jay Smith gave a cord of    wood and Mr. Selleck hauled it to the schoolhouse. So on with the    . rest, the' lamp, the' table, etc. A smaller room had been built on to    the wing by Mr. Harbison, for some years principal of the school; ­this    at his own expense and for the ' accommodation of his own library    which was used by the pupils; as he had severed his connection with    the school he generously gave this room over to our use, and it has    housed O11r' increasing family ever since. The closed bookcase was    moved in, the other shelves were filled, a few years later more shelves    were added until there was not room for a wren's nest anywhere. The    fine spirit of cooperation was again in evidence when a few years ago    the schoolhouse was newly roofed and painted. The new roof and    paint were extended to the library room with a refusal to send the    bill. In recent years they have for several summers lent the use of    the small school room to the library in vacation time as a place for    magazines; where they might be accessible and looked over at one's    ease.",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1121,1121,1122.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1122.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In March 1895 Miss Albertina Staub was appointed librarian at    the munificent salary of $ 10.00 a year, in June secretary and treasurer.    These offices she held until her resignation in 1911, and more than that,    for she also held the library and the society together all these years,    through times of stress and threatened disintegration. Nor has she    ever ceased from interest and labors in its behalf. Mrs. H. P. Selleck    was an English woman, highly educated, of fine ability and culture.    She was vice- president for years and presided well in the absence of    the president. She also did much work in these early days in keeping    the library, in procuring gifts of books and in various ways.    In 1895 there were generous donations of books and also efforts    to raise money for the library on the part of other organizations, and    this year entered the women on the stage. They made useful and    fancy articles and devoted a table for the sale of these articles and of    flowers at fairs held by the Unitarian Alliance and by the King's    Daughters; $ 21.88 they made for the library. So much for the spirit    of sisterhood.    Not far from this period, perhaps earlier, a concert was given at    ~ he Smith House as a Library Benefit. Highlands had a fine little    amateur string quintet under the direc. tion of Mr. Louis Zoellner, which    rendered classical music very pleasantly.    About this time it was discovered that while many valuable books    had been donated, the library had also been made a dumping ground    for cheap trash that people wanted to get rid of,- harmful trash. I    brought the matter before the society, as it was through a curious    personal experience that this state of affairs was brought to my at­tention.    A Book Committee was appointed by the president to look    into this condition and eliminate the undesirable :- Mrs. Mary Chapin    Smith, chairman, Mrs. H. P. Selleck, and the librarian, Miss Staub.    ( Miss Staub and I have always remained members of this committee up to    1931.) This was March 11, 1895. With occasional changing members    and enlarged functions, including the selection and purcha. se of books    and magazines, this committee has existed to this day, now 1931 ( for    these few lines regarding it have been written recently), and it has    marked undoubtedly the quality of this library as its own; through the    years in its whole changing personnel it has always worked with un­tiring    determination and a high ambition. At the beginning for months    an incredible amount of time was spent in censorship; sifting, sifting    the books, rejecting the absolutely harmful and vulgar, and also freeing    the shelves from much that was not only antiquated but valueless.    From that time on there was a high mark set as the aim of the    library, to offer the best in science, nature study, literature, history,    travel and general subjects as well as in fiction, just as far as possible.    Very few free libraries in small country places have such a choice    selection of the world's best books as this little Hudson Library in the    remote mountain town of Highlands.    The need of money was very great. Summer visitors freely used    the books, and repeatedly asked to be allowed to pay something for    the use and the wear and tear. The books were wearing out and there    was little or no money to replace them or buy new ones. It was    decided to make a small charge to the summer visitors, keeping the    library free to the year round residents of Highlands, Shortoff and",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1122,1122,1123.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1123.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histor~ of the Hudson Librar~ Association    vicinity, according to the original conditions. The receipts from the    visitors for the first summer, 1898, were $ 6.15, but in a few years they    more than doubled and trebled, and were a very helpful addition to the    membership fees. This same year, 1898, saw the library open twice a    week, and later it was opened three times a week during the summer.    Meantime the gifts increased; it seemed to be understood that only    books worth while were desired, and many valuable ones were bestowed    by individuals, residents of this town, guests and friends of summer    guests. Ev~ n the distant Smith College students, of Northampton,    Mass., were interested and gave books through Miss Mary Aubin    Harris, the artist, who, with her mother, spent her summers here, paint­ing    in charming water colors our beautiful woods. The full set of    Dickens came through her in 1899; also many other good and valuable    books. High class magazines were donated. A subscription for St.    Nicholas was given for several years by one household in this town,    the Faraway ladies, and I venture to say that nothing was ever so    much appreciated by the children and young folks, both resident and    visiting,- and their elders were not far behind. Even when read to    pieces the fragments were treasured and read again. In 1901 the    Ladies' Floral and Industrial Society of Highlands gave over $ 30.00 to    the association, much of which was to defray arrears in the librarian's    salary, and in 1903 the library received over $ 135.00 from the same    source, the Floral Society having quietly, gently drawn its last breath,    leaving by will its membership to the new Horticultural Society, and    its wealth to the Hudson Library Association. All this money was to    be used in purchase of books, and was so expended, much of it during    the next year. In 1904 there was another windfall. Mr. Allan Holton,    of San Mateo, Fla., gave a wonderful impersonation of David Garrick    and Mr. Willmshurst sang. Some will remember the latter's beautiful,    highly trained tenor voice which we used to hear for many summers.    We also remember Miss Georgie Robi~ son, talented and efficient, and    how much she helped about the arrangements. All Floridians and    friends. This entertainment netted the library $ 22.00, which was used    entirely for the purchase of books. .    About this time the library was catalogued and a number of copies    were printed, the catalog including most of these purchases, but as we    went on buying a few books every year and people kept on giving,    in a few years there were very many books not in the printed catalog.    In some instances as many as a hundred books were given by' one    family at a time. Many of the residents of Highlands were among    these liberal donors.    In 1906 Mr. and Mrs. Harbison joined, an especially welcome ad­dition    to the membership; Mrs. Duncan Dougall gave a nice glass door    in order to make the library accessible from the street. We had    heretofore gone through the school room, a great inconvenience. This    was as good as an extra window for light and gave us great comfort.    About this time Dr. Lapham gave $ 10.80 for "" The Ten Little Peppers.""    This was such a joy to the children as never was before, and ranked    with the St. Nicholas in the struggle for possession. About this time    came books from Dr. O'Farrell's library, donated by the daughter, Mrs.    Reeoer, and the grandson, Ralph Graham; also books from the library",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1123,1123,1124.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1124.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B. Wheaton; the Elliotts gave many books as they always    have done, valuable contributions generously offered.    In 1906, the very interesting and efficient Horticultural Society of    Highlands, having died after a short but severe illness, willed $ 10.90 in    cash to us for the purchase of books, and later there came from the    same source a gift of a small but very choice collection of horticultural    lore, including some rare volumes, now difficult to obtain, by the first    American landscape gardener, A. J. Downing; and also including several    years of the incomparable Garden and Forest, splendidly illustrated,    whose contributors were the leading botanists, arboriculturists, explorers    and landscape gardeners of America. We still have this in the library,    a precious treasure ( 1931). This was so expensive to publish that its    publication was discontinued in a few years. An early number in my    possession contained an account of the finding of the famous Shortia    galacifolia. This account 1 gave to the Highlands Museum. The    Shortia of the journal and herbarium of the French botanist and ex­plorer    Michaux was sought for over one hundred years, Asa Gray    and Professor Sargent being among the seekers, and it was finally    found on the banks of the Whitewater, N. C. The line drawing il­lustrating    Shortia in this magazine, though of the ' 80' s, would do credit    to the present day. That is characteristic of this publication.    For quite a period along about 1908 there was a very queer time    about getting a quorum, the number requisite being five; a small    number but you know how it is,- some have bought five yoke of oxen    and another has married a wife, "" I pray thee have me excused;"" and    there you are; it was so bad that for a long time we were unable to    transact business. In May, 1908, we got desperate, and there was a    regular impressment comparable to that of sailors for service on a    ship. I ran out and caught the Rev. Alfred Lawrence and Mr. Farns­worth,    who amiably consented to join, and we had OUT quorum for that    meeting. Soon afterward we &lt;: hanged the constitution back to the    original fOTm, "" The number present shall constitute a quorum."" This    is handy, but I am happy to say that in spite of fears we have never    been reduced to considering one person a quorum!    By 1911 there was what there always had been, talk of a library    building; but now it was serious. We were like the old woman who    lived in a shoe, only we had so many books we didn't know what to    do. We must build, but first we must buy a lot. The village was    carefully investigated, and the choice narrowed down to the Rideout    lot on which this new building stands, aU other lots proving unavailable    or undesirable. This lot was purchased for $ 60.00, and more than enough    money was raised for it in a few days, the surplus being added later to    the building fund. Mrs. James Rideout told me that she very much    wished she could give the lot,- she would like to do something for    Highlands; but the other heirs of which there were many, including    children, could hardly consider it. I think we should give the elder    Mrs. Rideout credit for the will, if not the deed. She spoke' to me    about it with a touching warmth and sincerity.    The north boundary of this lot, 80 feet from east to west, is a    continuation of the north boundary line of the Episcopal Church lot,    in the same direction exactly. The Rideouts specified to me that they    did not wish this line broken, and they also had to reserve the spring",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1124,1124,1125.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1125.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The south boundary line happens to be in this case in the middle    of Main Street; the Episcopal Church corner is marked by a stone    sunken at the intersection of Main and Fifth Streets. The library lot    boundaries have to be calculated from this.    After this came the tug of war,- to raise money enough for a    building. We began with a Loan Exhibit in 1912 which, with its ac­cessories    and some donations, gave us $ 73.21. This was given in the    large dining room, hall and parlor of the Smith House. It was really    a wonderful thing; the interest, beauty and artistic character of many    of the exhibits were undeniable. The late Dr. Emma L. Bilstein was    staying at our house at the time, and she gave us the benefit of her    assistance and exquisite taste. Another person who helped us in this    entertainment was a member of the gifted Benet family, herself gifted,    Miss Laura Benet, whose poems we have in the library. She is a sis­ter    of William Rose Benet and Stephen Benet.    We had decided that we did not wish to appeal for cash subscrip­tions    until we had done all we could otherwise. As a matter of fact,    we have not been around with a subscription paper at all, although    Mrs. S. P. Ravenel, Sr., begged me to start a subscription paper at    the end of the Loan Exhibit, and said she herself would give a goodly    amount. It was then too late in the afternoon, however, and 1 knew    how the members felt about it at this early stage, so I did nothing;    but the dear lady shortly after made an unsolicited gift of $ 100.00 to­ward    the library building fund. This most generous gift was the largest    sum that came to us in anyone way, and as her death occurred only a    few months afterward, I can not think of it without a feeling that the    tears are very near.    Soon after the Sanatorium gave an entertainment for the library    which nett~ d $ 24.50. From that time on other entertainments followed;    a card party at Mrs. Perry's netted $ 10.50, a lawn party at the Ander­sons    given by Mrs. A. P. Anderson and Miss Crosby over $ 88.00, a    concert at Mrs. A. P. Anderson's over $ 42.00, the flower show at Mrs.    Sloan's over $ 8.00; Mrs. Jones, a sister of Mrs. Bascom, gave a fas­cinating    Travel Talk which brought in $ 15.00, and a card party at Mrs.    Lamb's $ 12.00 more.    During this time we were encouraged to think that we might get    a Carnegie Building. The matter was thoroughly investigated and    came to nothing. We concluded that we had better in any case go    ahead and rely on ourselves and be independent afterward ( even if    we were not "" rich' and independent"").    Meantime generous cash donations kept coming in; one from Miss    M. D. Warren was as large as $ 50.00, and quite a number of others    were for $ 25.00 and thereabouts.    Last summer ( 1914) several plans for a building were submitted to    the society and one was selected. They were made by Mr. Huger El­liott,    one of the Directors of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and    this very busy man has taken of his time to make also the working    drawings for us, and it is largely due to his genius and kindness that    we have secured such a beautiful home for our Hudson Library with    the least possible expenditure. The contract was given to Mr. Walter    Reese, the lowest bidder, for $ 553.00, windows and doors not included;",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1125,1125,1126.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1126.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The foregoing pages are very much as they were read at the    dedication of the new building, July 4, 1915; with two exceptions, how­ever:    I was requested to cut out the many names that were like a    constellation in these building years; these I restored; also a few    items of interest to us old timers or facts of practical use have been    introduced in their proper places, as having no other place.",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1126,1126,1127.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1127.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Historq of the Hudson Libran;) Association    Right here one might tell of something which links the old with    the new. I have spoken of the St. Nicholas in its valued tatters and    of the welcome use in vacation time of the smaller school room with    its desks, so c. omfortable for the reading of the magazines; and we all    know of Stephen Vincent Benet, of his early noteworthy work, and    how later fame came to him suddenly with the publication of "" John    Brown's Body."" When he was a lovable boy in his very early teens or    perhaps younger he used to spend his summers here. Every library    day he appeared in this reading room and was shortly glued down to    some old ragged St. Nicholas, forgetting all the world without. When    time came to close up, believe me, it was a task to unglue him. Very    loth to interrupt such joys, it was my painful duty to pry him loose    and drive him out, but I did it, little realizing with what affectionate    pride we would think of him in the near future.    As we settled in our new quarters Miss Marie Huger procured    material and studied the best card catalog system preparatory to in­troducing    it here, while Mrs. Perry and others brought order out of    chaos in the fiction department. Miss Louise Billstein, a professional    librarian, worked several summer vacations in later years on a card    catalog, and gave much expert assistance. .    We are indebted to so many in the matter of books and magazines,    so many people have been most generous in giving, that it is imJ) os­sible    to tell of them all, but some who are residents of Highlands I    must mention. The Sloans for years have given not only in large    numbers but many rare and costly books; the Ravene1s, the Foremans,    Mrs. S. N. Evins, Mrs. Salinas, the Durgins, the Crosbys, the Faraway    people, the Bascoms, all have given freely; and in money some have    made donations in many successive years, especially the Ravenels and    Miss M. D. Warren. Very many summer guests and their friends    from outside Highlands have made most valuable gifts of books. With­out    their assistance we could not have survived. They have been    hdpful also in opening the library, for in the summer season we    try to have it open every day. A few of the young girls who reside    here the year round have been dependable, courteous, dignified, willing,    careful and skilful in this work; among them of recent years and the    present time are Miss Louise Edwards and Miss Stella Marett, also    Miss Sarah Hicks Hines, who has helped much in the winter. This is    a long list of qualifications that are imperatively necessary, but these    girls have showed them. We thank them here. Would that they were    not so few.    Neither can I speak of all of our officers, but some have been    notable. A few early ones have been mentioned. At the period of the    building and dedication, before and after, Mrs. Hampton Perry was    president. She presided most charmingly at our dedicatory exercises,    and she was always a most graceful, agreeable and efficient president.    She also for years did much work as librarian and in various ways,    with the assistance of her daughter and nieces.    Miss Marie Huger in addition to other activities was secretary for    some years, and furnished the only instance I have known where the    records were in part pure literature and flashed with wit. We enjoyed    and appreciated it.    Mrs. Salinas for years has been treasurer, absolutely accurate, and",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1127,1127,1128.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1128.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She has also been everything else to the library. One of her late    acc, omplishments has been to see to the painting and renovation of    . the building, outside and in, and beautifully done. There is none like    her and we love her for it.    We have had some wonderful librarians; Miss Staub' I have spoken    of before; Miss Charlotte Elliott; Miss Lucy Elliott, who introduced    some of the finest of the classics in English fiction and Greek literature    to the library; among them the novels of George Meredith and some    of the very best translations of the ancient Greek classics,- and we    know that means the difference between reading them with delight and    not being able to read them at all. There was another person, the late    Mrs. Luther Rice ( Christine Anderson),- she was a marvel; possessed    of more than usual executive ability which she exerted in various    ways, notably in her home first of all, notably in the library, also for    years in conjunction with Miss Albertina Staub on the Trails Com­mittee    of the Highlands Improvement Society, a committee which, as    long as land conditions allowed the opportunity, did much remarkable    work. She was a poet with the genuine gift, her poems celebrating    her beloved mountains with beauty, deep insight and feeling ;- but I    wish to speak of her as librarian; she knew the library from one end    to the other, she studied up various devices to increase its efficiency    and attractiveness, and- this was the wonder of it- she could get    people to read the best things in the library and the books best adapted    to them; the highest gift a librarian can have. And is it easy? Just    try it and see. Mrs. S. T. Marett was a great worker and a fine    organizer; there was great executive ability, none better; she put the    recording of books given out on an entirely different basis, a distinct    improvement over our old way. Her reports to the state showed a    very high record. Two daughters of Professor Harbison whom Mrs.    Marett had trained in library work succeeded her; Miss Gertrude    Harbison as librarian, and Miss Dorothea as assistant. They not only    have done credit to Mrs. Marett's training and to their predecessors,    but to the education and culture which they have derived from their    celebrated father. In all ways these charming girls have been wonders;    everyone speaks of it. By virtue of their office they are members of    the Book Committee, and invaluable members, as they keep in duse    touch with the best of the current literature. We open the library    for two or three hours once a week in the winter, two or three times    a week in spring and fall, and every day in summer. Most of the    work all these years has been volunteer work.    1 will quote here from Miss Harbison's last yearly report to the    State.

Historq of the Hudson Librarq Association    The smallest number of books was added by gift and purchase last    year of any year since 1927. The fewest were purchased last year of    any year of which we have a record.    Miss Rebecca NaIl for very many years has been a stand- by in    various ways; she has acted as librarian; she has also at different    times been an efficient secretary, and has raised money by entertain~    ments; the late Mrs. Lamb Perry was another good friend whom we    could ill afford to lose; others are Mrs. M. Martin, always a warm    friend of the library; Mrs. C. Albert Hill, whose devotion is invaluable    wherever she bestows it; Miss Louise Bascom who gave us her val­uable    assistance for several years; and Miss Louise Billstein also ( the    name Louise seemed to carry a charm); Miss Vaughn, head of the    High School, was secretary a short time; Mrs. Annie Pierson, the fine    High School teacher and often principal, acted for a short year as    secretary, and we were sorry to lose her. She also gave the library    valuable books from the High School; her old pupils, Joe and Mar­guerite    Richert, gave a large consignment of their own books, fine    and in beautiful condition. Mrs. Dorothy Crosby was an excellent    secretary for a short time; also Mrs. Lillian Pearson; Mrs. Gilbert was    secretary in recent years. Mrs. S. T. Marett was also secretary as    well as a remarkable librarian; her friends, the T. P. Andersons, have    given books. and have taken much interest; Miss May Crosby has al­ways    done everything of all kinds for the library; Miss Charlotte    Elliott I must speak of again; she has shown her devotion for years    in many ways, but I especially remember how she helped Mrs. Luther    Rice out as librarian when Mr. Rice had a long illness, and how one    period of her librarianship was during a terrible winter when she    seemed to think that duty called her to come down the mountain    through zero storms.. Miss Warren has always been a stanch friend,    generous not only in money, but in time and efficient work, as witness,    her work on the committee at the recent benefit on the golf grounds.    Many books are lost or kept far overtime and sorrow and trouble    ensue to us in authority, as when we lost ( and never found) Edna St.    Vincent Millay's "" Buck in the Snow"" soon after publication and very    soon after purchase. So we created an oddity in office, and Mrs. Hines    was appointed official book chaser, and while she held the office she    met with very considerable success. It was not pleasant, however.    People were apt to take offense; the greater the sinner the more was    the sinner offended! Mrs. Salinas has also acted in that capacity,    suggesting a highly trained retriever, so many books did she bring    home, at one time every missing book. Mrs. Hines has also acted    very efficiently as a prop to the tottering footsteps of the aged presi­dent,    who needed a sprinting double to support her in the most active    of her activities.

I feel like the student, and as my reminiscences grow    my enthusiasm waxes until I am in danger of becoming maudlin as a    drunkard in his cups.    In 1925 Dr. Harry Kelsey of Baltimore, the son of the founder of    Highlands, gave the little compass, secured in an attractive case, with    which his father first surveyed and laid out, the town of Highlands.    This interesting relic is on a shelf at the right hand as you leave    the vestibule and enter the main library room. We treasure this as    something precious connected with the early history of our beloved    Highlands.    In recent years we have put in water and electric lights, and we    have persuaded the Town Council to give us the use of these necessary    luxuries free of charge, and to these successive boards we tender our    hearty thanks.    In 1927 it was discovered that our charter of incorporation had run    out some little time before. Mr. Henry G. Robertson, Esq., very freely    gave us his assistance in renewing our charter, and also in other ways.    In 1927 an arrangement was made between the Hudson Library    Association and the Highlands Museum and Biological Station by which    the latter society had the privilege of extending the library building    toward the east and occupying that extension five years, possibly longer    under certain conditions, sharing their proportion of painting and in­surance,    etc. After the period of rental shall have expired the Library    Association will have the addition. The Museum has given us most    agreeable neighbors, and we are in no haste to acquire our new proper­ty,    but on the contrary we shall be sorry to lose them. The Library    Association is represented on the Museum's Board of Trustees.    Through a series of years we have raised money by various de­vices,    concerts, card parties, and other things innumerable. Mrs. James    Anderson is a fine musician, a pianist, and she has given us several    times a concert for the benefit of the library, and Miss Jones has    given us readings. A few summers ago some children, Elise and    Eleanor Terhune and Betty Bell gave a Barn Party so as to raise    money to buy "" The Colonial Twins"" and "" The Philippine Twins"" for the    library. The fact that this thing was done wholly of their own in­itiative    adds a special grace to the gift. But perhaps the most charm­ing    of all have been the benefits given by Mrs. H. L. Parry of Camp    Parry- dise. Twice she and her Parry- dise Players gave Browning's    "" Pied Piper of Hamelin"" in the grounds of the Smith Cottage. It was    an artistic event to be remembered.    A few weeks ago Mrs. S. T. Marett went to Mr. and Mrs. Scott    Hudson. He is President of the Highlands Estates, and Mrs. Marett    asked them to let their people give a card party at the Club House for    the library. They proposed something better. On the fifteenth of    August "" Bobby"" Jones was to play with other fine players on their    golf links, and with Mr. Jones' permission and that of the others the    gate proceeds could be devoted to the Hudson Library. Our banking    account was reduc. ed to 33c besides a very slight amount in the li-    . brarian's hands for running expenses, and when nearly $ 600.00 was    handed to us there was near being the spectacle of a whole society",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1130,1130,1131.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1131.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was felt that those who have contributed most in their    efforts for libraries in Winston- Salem should be recognized at the close of the    first fifty years. This record or history is written as a tribute to those who have    been faithful through the years to the cause. of libraries in this compmnity.    The persons who have assisted in the writing of this history have been    interested or associated with the public library for many years. Miss Mary C.    Wiley who has written of the early events and struggles, was a teacher in the    public schools of Winston- Salem for many years, and an ardent supporter and    library user. Miss Wiley has in later years edited a column in the local paper.    Mrs. Jessie Stroup who has contributed to this history from a well of    experience, as both a patron and a librarian, has covered some of the most    eventful years of the library. Mrs. Stroup was connected with the Carnegie    Library for 19 years, retiring in 1946.    Mrs. Mae Tillman grew up in Winston- Salem, and spent many pleasant    hours reading in the library and reading library books. After Mrs. Tillman    became a librarian she followed her profession to other cities but returned to    her native city to become associated with the institution which had meant    much to her in childhood. Mrs. Tillman has covered the most difficult period    in this history- the depression and war years. The compiler has covered the    most eventful years, and the years of greatest activitY.    The persons named here have my sincere thanks for their part in recording    the events of this institution. I should like to express my appreciation for    assistance rendered by Miss Jeannette Trotter, and other members of the library    staff who have assisted in the preparation of this history.

As Chairman of the Winston School Board, Mr. Buxton saw the need of    establishing a free circulating library as a means' not only of furthering the    work of the public schools of the community, but of developing the cultural    life of those citizens who had been denied the advantages of higher education    and enabling them through access to well- assorted books and periodicals to    acquire broader, stronger interests in State, national, and world affairs.    The Chamber of Commerce entered heartedly into the movement and    appointed Mr. Buxton chairman of "" A Committee on a Public Library."" On    May 29, 1900, Chairman Buxton appeared before the Chamber, urging that    immediate steps be taken in the establishing of a free circulating library for    the community even though in the beginning it be but a small library.    PUBLIC SLOW TO RESPOND TO LIBRARY MOVEMENT    But it was no easy matter awakening the public to the need of a community    library. Our people, like all other North Carolinians, have a reputation,    brought from colonial days, of going slowly when it comes to the matter of    taxation; and in the early 1900' s the governing boards of Winston and Salem    were loathe to bring before their fellow citizens the question of an additional    tax for the establishing and maintaining of a free circulating library- even    though that tax increase per capita be pennies, not dollars.    And so far as any official action in the matter, the library movement made    little headway for two years and more. However, Mr. Buxton would not give    up his efforts for what he considered a real need for the growing community.    Time and again he brought the matter to the attention of the Chamber of    Commerce and by personal contact sought the support of individu~ l citizens,    of both towns. To acquaint the general public with the library idea, he called    for a mass meeting of the citizens of Winston in February 1903, but the few    persons who braved the inclement weather to attend the meeting were already    friends of the library movement.    Finally, in the spring of 1903, he personally solicited Andrew Carnegie for    financial assistance to Winston and Salem, such as he had given other com­munities,    in the establishing of a public library. Mr. Carnegie most generously    responded to this appeal.    Since the 1903 files of our local dailies, The Sentinel and the Journal, were    destroyed by fire, we have no means of knowing the' citizens' reaction to Mr.    Carnegie's proposal; the first official reaction is found in the minute book of the    Salem Commissioners ( now in City Hall).

MR. BUXTON'S LETTER    After the time- honored custom of Moravian keepers- of- records, Mr. Buxton's    letter giving Mr. Carnegie's first offer was carefully preserved in the minute    book of the Commissioners of Salem. The letter reads as follows:    To the Commissioners of Salem    Gentlemen:    Last spring in a personal interview which I had with Mr. Carnegie he    expressed himself as willing to build a library for this community, and fixed    $ 25,000 as the amount which he would give us. The conditions attached to this    gift are that Winston- Salem should give a lot and agree to pay ten per cent    upon the amount he gives for the annual support of the Library.    If Winston- Salem officials would join forces in the undertaking, it seems    that it can be accomplished without any great hardship upon their corporations.    I lay the matter before you to do with as you think best. I desire to let    Mr. Carnegie know what the decision is as soon as I can. I have address~ d a    similar communication to the commissioners of Winston.    August 12, 1903.    Respectfully,    ( Signed) J. C. BUXTON    The Reference Committees appointed by the official boards of Winston    and Salem to confer on the proposition of Mr. Carnegie as given in Mr. Buxton's    letter met and after careful thought handed in their report that it was not    advisable at the time to undertake the erection of a community library. And so    the matter rested until December 21, when Mr. Buxton presented to the Winston    Board of Aldermen a second proposition he had obtained from Mr. Carnegie;    namely, that Mr. Carnegie Was "" willing to give the City of WinstOn the sum    of Fifteen Thousand Dollars, provided the City of Winston would appropriate    $ 1,500 per year for the maintenance and supporf of the library and provide a    suitable site for said building.""    This second offer was accepted and a building committee, consisting of    Mr. J. C. Buxton, the Mayor of Winston ( 0. B. Eaton) and Mr. James K.    Norfleet was appointed "" to have the whole matter in charge.""

CARNEGIE LIBRARY ERECTED    The east comer of old West End School property fronting Fourth Street    was the first site suggested by the Building Committee for the proposed public    library. However, after due consideration, the Winston Board of Aldermen in    the spring of 1904 selected the more central location, Cherry and Third- the    purchase price being $ 2, OOO- gave Fogle Brothers of Salem the contract to    erect on this site the modest little Carnegie Library- considered very handsome    in its day.    By August 1905 the building was so nearly completed that the evening    of September 17th was fixed as the date of its formal presentation to the city    of Winston. Two nights before this date, fire was discovered in the basement    of the building, but thanks to the prompt action of the Winston fire department    no serious damage resulted and the exercises for the formal opening proceeded    as planned. In the presence of a representative group of citizens in the small    lecture room on the lower floor, Bishop Edward Rondthaler presented the new    building to the City, and Mayor O. B. Eaton received it. Mr. Eugene E. Gray    and other friends of the library made short addresses, and Dr. Henry A. Brown    closed the meeting with fervent prayer for God's blessing upon the institution.    The West End School Library, considered the best public school library    in the State, was transferred to the Carnegie Library, and while the repairs    to the building made necessary by the fire were proceeding, Mrs. Mary C.    Prather, the newly elected librarian, and The Library Committee- the old    building committee- were kept busy selecting additional volumes to place on    the empty shelves and making ready for the formal opening of the library for    the distribution of books.    This took place on February 14, 1906, five years and seven months from    the date Mr. J. C. Buxton appeared before the Chamber of Commerce, urging    the establishment of a free circulating library for our growing community.    EARLY YEARS OF CARNEGIE LIBRARY    The following item from the Twin City Daily Sentinel of February 20,    1909, is the earliest record we have of Carnegie Library. The destruction of the    Sentinel Building, Liberty Street, shortly after World War One caused the loss    of the files of local daily newspapers covering the beginning years of the    library, and unfortunately no annual reports of our first librarian can be located.    "" The Carnegie Library of Winston- Salem was three years old on February    14th.    "" It begins its 4th year under the most favorable auspices, for it seems to    be growing in favor every day.

Prather, librarian, and Miss Cassie Rose,    . assistant- librarian, is well nigh pedect. Over 20,000 books have been sent out    during the ( three) years.""    The assistant librarian referred to above, was a school girl who, for the    munificent salary of $ 8 per month, devoted her after- school hours and Satur­days    to the library, dusting book shelves, if necessary, mending books, giving    out books when Mrs. Prather's official duties called her away from the circula.    tion desk.    Miss Myrtle Johnson ( Mrs. D. D. Moir) from .1911 to 1915 served as    second assistant librarian. Her beginning salary was $ 12 a month, for she    was on duty five days a week from 10 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon,    and in addition to helping the librarian in various and sundry ways, she had    charge of the children's room, southwest comer of the building, and on Saturday    afternoons told stories to the children who gathered there- of pre- school age    to early teen age.    From a statistical report made for the Carnegie Corporation, bearing the    date September 17, 1915, we learn that the number of persons on the staff of    the Carnegie Library during the first three years was one and the salaries and    wages were $ 600; that there were two staff members during the next three    years and the salaries were $ 750. From this report we also learn that the    library contained 3,042 volumes in 1906 and had 1,226 card holders.    On the seventh anniversary of the library, open house was held during    the evening for the purpose of receiving gifts of books. The Twin City Daily    Sentinel in writing of this occasion, February 15, 1913, has this to say:    "" The reception held at Carnegie Library last night was a notable success    ... The reception was held to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the opening    of the library to the citizens of Winston and Salem.    Mrs. Mary C. Prather, librarian, and Miss Myrtle Johnson, assistant, acted    as hostesses on the happy occasion and were the recipients of many compliments    upon their successful management of the institution.

On September 1 of that same year Miss Pamela Bynum succeeded Mrs.    Mary C. Prather as librarian of the Carnegie Library. Miss Bynum was popular    and efficient with a Hair for attracting cooperation and favorable publicity.    Throughout her term she edited for the Sentinel "" Carnegie Library Notes,"" a    column devoted to all sorts of library and book news.    Much emphasis has always been given to the Children's Department.    The southwest comer room on the main Hoor of the building was used as the    children's room for many years. The children of earlier days loved their library    even as do their children today.

In 1914 a tag day raised $ 124 for children's books. The Barber Printing    Company gave the tags and a prize to the young lady selling the most.    A story hour was conducted once' a month by various ladies and gentlemen.    Miss Bynum's report for 1914 states that 432 children attended these story    hours that year.    In 1913 Mrs. Roscoe S. Wall came to Winston, a bride, and soon as a    volunteer took over story hour. Many a prominent citizen of Winston- Salem    will remember Mrs. ' Vall's "" Bottle Babies."" The local chapter of the American    Institute of Child Life sponsored the series. They provided a sand table on    which elaborate scenes were set. The characters were dolls made of bottles    dressed in authentic costumes. Keen rivalry developed as a doll was presented    each story hour to the child whose birthday was nearest the date. Mrs. Wall    told the stories- some original, some fairy stories and some from history or    classis myths. Of her characters, Mrs. Wall herself liked best the Lady of    Shalotte, who had been a most beautiful pedume bottle. These story hours    were so popular- that they drew capacity crowds twice a month. A Puritan    Thanksgiving story had 125 children as audience, and the time of the story    hour had to be changed from afternoon to 10 o'clock in the morning and chil­dren    only admitted.    In 1921 the Literature Department of the Woman's Club took the respon­sibility    for story hour. Mrs. W. L. Reid, with her committee, prepared an    attractive, printed year book, and each story hour was in charge of a member    of the department.    The children were moved to the large room on the ground floor when a    trained children's librarian- Miss Louel Collins- was employed in June 1924,    and a new chapter in their work began.    The room formerly used for the children was converted into a badly needed    reference room.    Mrs. Lindsay Patterson headed North Carolina's observance of the ter­centennial    celebration of Shakespeare's death. Miss Eleanor Follin was chair­man    of the local committee who arranged an elaborate exhibit at the library.    Exhibits, bearing on all periods of the poet's life and work, consisted of pictures,    books, curios in cabinets and models of buildings. It was an amazing and    varied collection that reflected great credit on the cultural resources and    generosity of the many people who worked on Miss Follin's committee. The    exhibit was arranged on the walls and mantels so that it did not intedere with    regular library work. It was displayed for a month, from March 23 to April 23,    1916. Easter fell during this time and many Salem visitors shared it with the    regular library patrons.    Most of the exhibits were loaned but some were presented to the library;    a fine bust of Shakespeare was given by Mrs. W. N. Reynolds and a model of    the old Globe Theater, made by the manual training class of the High School,    remained a point of interest in the children's room for twenty years.    Meantime the library was growing lustily. During the first ten years of    the library's history the collection of books increased from 3,042 to 8,108; the    11",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1156,1156,1157.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1157.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The things, presumably used as book markers, which people leave in    returned books amaze and amuse librarians. In a 1914 Sentinel a reporter    lists a few of Miss Bynum's finds- the perennial letters, post cards and handker­chiefs.    Also a whole chapter about changing fashions is suggested by the    following: many hairpins, a barrette, two trunk keys, a cigarette flag, many    button hooks, a fine tooth comb, a whole pack of two- cent stamped envelopes,    a ladies' lead coat or skirt weight and a five dollar bill.    SERVICE EXTENDED TO COUNTY    County Demonstration Agent, Bruce Anderson, presented to the County    Commissioners a request from the people of the county that they be permitted    the use of the city library. The matter was discussed and approved, but when    the Commissioners met with the County School Board to take official action,    they found that neither had authority to appropriate IIloney to maintain this    extension work. At the next session of the Legislature State Senator James A.    Gray secured the passage of a law to permit County Commissioners and County    School Boards to appropriate funds for the extension of library privileges of any    town to the people of the county in which the town is located. This bill was    passed March 5, 1917.    Not until December 1, 1921, did the county take advantage of this oppor­tunity,    when it appropriated $ 2,000 for library service. On January 1, 1923,    the appropriation of $ 2,000 was discontinued. The following year it was rein­stated    but cut in half. From 1924 on, except for two years in the depths of the    depression, ours has been a county library, although one year the county ap­propriated    only $ 500 and until 1938, only $ 1,000 a year.    For the first years county residents were given the same service as city    patrons. Later, collections of books were sent to county schools. These collec­tions    were changed frequently and circulated under the care of the teachers.    In the late 20' s the movement for county bookmobiles reached our State. In    1928 the Library Commission encouraged friendly patrons to contribute $ 100,    our assessed share, toward the purchase of two bookmobiles which were used by    the State Library Commission as demonstrators. Many years later Forsyth    County purchased a bookmobile, but that belongs later in our story.    WORLD WAR I ACTIVITIES    World War I brought to all libraries extra work and opportunities. In her    report for 1918 Miss Bynum wrote: "" The library has been flooded with requests    to collect books for soldiers and sailors; to raise money for the maintainance    of camp libraries; to give publicity to food conservation, until the walls resemble    a patch work quilt with the variety of posters. To the librarian. with a vision    of service in a world safe for democracy this has been a busy year.    .

Many things had been accomplished    during her eight- year term, the last being the opening of the library to county    patrons.    Mrs. Marie F. Kilburn of Talladega, Alabama, was elected her successor.    She was unable to come until February 1, so Miss Bynum consented to remain    through January.    Like a growing child, North Carolina's development was irregular. Com­menting    upon it, the editor of the Journal takes interest in automobiles, good    roads and books as his criteria for measuring progress. He records that in 1922    there were as many automobiles owned in our State as there were books in our    public libraries. Against that appalling background Mrs. Kilburn reported that    4,178 library members read 51,320 books, or more than 8 books apiece. .    Substantial use of the library continued, far exceeding its facilities. Cir­culation    increased from 51,320 in 1922 to 121,024 in 1925. The number of    readers kept pace, but the space remained the same and already was so limited    as to handicap service severely.    In August 1925 Mrs. Kilburn resigned, Miss Janet C. Berkeley was ap­pointed    to fill the position and began her work October 1. Miss Berkeley, a    graduate of Atlanta Library School, had done graduate work in English at    William and Mary College. She had worked in The Greensboro Public Library    and also in the Public Library of Norfolk, Virginia.    BRANCH SERVICE INAUGURATED    The opening of Reynolds High School with its fine school library relieved    pressure, especially upon the reference work. But the library was still faced by    an acute space shortage. The Library Commission considered all phases of thi.&gt;    problem and decided that opening several branch libraries would serve current    needs better than would the construction of a new building.    13",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1158,1158,1159.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1159.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Creech appointed Mr.    Meade H. Willis and the Rev. Douglas Rights a committee to explore and report    on this plan. They recommended that four branches should be located in    various sections of the city, at least one of which should provide for the Negro    population.    Already, as test experiments, a county branch had been opened in Kerners­ville,    sponsored by the Kernersville Woman's Club. A deposit station was    placed in the Center Drug Company, 1601 Centerville Street and was kept    open on Wednesday afternoons by a member of the library staff. So popular    were these that another was added in the People's National Bank at 1344 N.    Liberty Street, open on Monday afternoons. Mr. J. H. Stancill, the manager    of the Center Drug Company, and the directors of the bank gave space for    these deposit stations; for such they really were, rather than branch libraries.    The next year a third such station was opened in the Liberty Drug Company    through the courtesy of Mr. W. M. Taylor, the proprietor. This station was    immediately so popular as to crowd the store and it was found advisable to    move it to the Fairview School, where a room and shelves were provided.    The important branch library was the George Moses Horton Branch for    Negroes. This branch was first housed in a room loaned by the Chestnut Street    branch of the Y. W. C. A. and was opened February 15, 1927. The library    supplied the books, shelves and catalog case. Desk, reading table and chairs    were donated from the city hall.    In the interest of the library for colored people the Journal- Sentinel spon­sored    a concert of spirituals at the auditorium. The fund raised in this way    was used to buy books about Negroes and by Negro authors. In this way the    Horton Branch opened with a good beginning of this collection on its shelves.    Mrs. M. Y. Ray, Mrs. Mary Hairston and Mrs. Alvah Jones came regularly    to the Carnegie Library for some ~ eeks to receive instruction for carrying    on the work. With its opening Mrs. Hairston took charge of the branch as a    paid member of the library staff. Of all the branches established at this time    the Horton Branch is the only one to survive the vicissitudes of the depression,    and it thrives today as the East Winston Branch in its fine, new building:    Work at the Carnegie Library grew apace. On January 29, 1927, the    circulation for the first time exceeded 1,000 volumes, and the year's total was    155,363. The reading and reference rooms showed an attendance of almost    23,000. A total of 2,390 reference questions were answered. While the circula­tion    of books shows most to the public, it is through its reference department    that the library meets the calls for information and really helps those who seek    knowledge. Students from city and county schools and Salem College made up    the largest group of reference patrons. But members of book and study clubs    were a close second. It was said that the library had some part in preparing    every program given in Winston- Salem.    The hours were further extended, opening at 9 instead of 10 a. m. The    former custom of closing from 1 until 4 during the summer months was dis-continued.    . ,    The children's librarian at the Carnegie Library, in addition to her weekly    hour there, conducted one story hour a month at the Horton Branch Library    and many at schools, 70 story hours in all.

At this time she organized the    vacation reading clubs which became popular children's projects for years to    follow.    The North Carolina Collection- books about North' Carolina, by North    Carolina authors and North Carolina genealogy- received emphasis. A founda­tion    was laid for a collection soon to class as one of the best in its "" day.    There was a special demand in 1928 for material about Winston- Salem.    The newspaper files and clippings were much used. This material was re­arranged,    several special scrap books were made, and other items were mounted    for loose leaf filing in a large new cabinet.    For the year 1928 the circulation for the first time exceeded 200,000, reach­ing    a total of 203,809 books, an average of 662 books per day. This volume of    work was still handled by 5 full- time and 2 half- time assistants.    The library was so crowded and working conditions so difficult it is not    strange that Miss Berkeley a little wearily reported: "" The books at the Carnegie    Library now number 25,589. There were 2,661 accessions during the year with    1,633 withdrawals, making a net gain of only 1,028.. Of this added number 190    were gifts and 120 were bound volumes of magazines. With the increased use    of the library there is a crying need for new books. Many now being circulated    lare so worn they should be rebound or discarded.""    Two small additions to the extension work were most gratifying- collections    for the patients at City Memorial Hospital and at the County T. B. Sanatorium.    One day each week the librarian, with Miss Gertrude Dickhut, superintendent    of nurses, made the rounds of the rooms and wards, carrying books to the    bedside of each patient. At the sanatorium patients able to do light work issued    the books to other patients.    Despite shabby, inadequate equipment and building Winston- Salem people    loved the old Carnegie Library. Many gentle gifts proved that affection­conspicuously    and continuous attention of the garden clubs. Beautiful cut    flowers were kept freshly; replaced, the window boxes were planted each year,    and the little garden in the side yard with its brave show of early pansies and    blaze of late zinnias was a bit of gay embroidery on the down town picture.    The city gave care to shrubs, vines and lawn. Even the worn benches outside    the door all spoke a friendly atmosphere.    DEPRESSION YEARS    The fiscal year 1930/ 31, clinging to the golden 20' s that had brought    larger ( yet never standard) appropriations and a phenomenal 400% increase    in the circulation of books, trembled on the brink before plunging into a    volatile decade destined to be unique in the history of the library for its    contrasts. A decade that witnessed economy budgets, shorter hours, threadbare    books, overcrowded library facilities and defeat in a bond election. Yet, despite    all the vicissitudes that beleaguered this period, the librarians with unstinten.    efforts created a center of culture, information and recreation for the community;    and many people of the community, in tum, suppo. rted, appreciated and en-couraged    the library efforts.

There were 290 children enrolled and ninety- five completed    the course satisfactorily and received diplomas. Credit was given for "" research""    work on important reference questions of interest to children. A list of graded    questions on various subjects was posted at the library, and the children used    the reference books to obtain information. The young readers were offered    every possible inducement to interest them in adding to their store of knowledge,    to read for profit as well as pleasure. Titles of books approved by the library    in such subjects as travel, folklore, animal life, poetry, standard fiction and the    outdoors were posted.    So much activity was created by this reading program that editorial com­ment    was made in the Journal:    "" It is no unusual sight to see a boy or girl on the streets of Winston- Salem    with from one to a half dozen books under his or her arm. The youthful reader    either has been or is going to the library.    "" It appears that these book ' toters' are more numerous this summer than    ever before."" .    Scarcely had the ink dried on the diplomas before the fall- winter program    of story hours was launched and ambitious plans for Book Week were being    made by both Adult and Children's Departments. Miss Berkeley, Chairman    of Book Week Observance in the Fourth District composed of the counties of    Alleghany, Wilkes, Surry, Yadkin, Stokes and Forsyth, hoped to arrange the    largest and most far- reaching book celebration in the history of the city. Dr.    Frank Graham, President of the University of North Carolina, on accepting an    invitation to speak at this occasion wrote in his letter: "" I. hope you can arrange    a rally there that will spread the county- wide idea through the country and all    over the South."" When Dr. Graham was unable to speak, because of illness, this    meeting was cancelled.    In the children's room, however, when the ceiling fell on the eve of Book    ' Week, catastrophe was narrowly averted by a quick repair job. Special book    displays, story hours and a radio play-"" Visions from Bookland""- which had    won state- wide recognition for its author, Miss Collins, claimed the interest of    both adults and children. As one reads the cast of characters for this play    presented twenty- five years ago one cannot help but wonder what influences    the constant association with books and with activities guided by an under­standing    librarian had on the lives of these children. One member of the cast    who represented a story book doctor is now a doctor of Dentistry in Winston­Salem.    At present other members of the cast are the local city auditor, a teacher,    a city editor for the Sentinel and a resident in internal medicine at the hospital    of the University of Pennsylvania.    The economic structure of America began to take its toll at the Carnegie    Public Library in 1932.' Beginning with the fiscal year 1931/ 32 budgets were    drastically cut and never restored until 1946.

On    May 4, 1932, in order to supplement the great demand for cl! rrent books seven    new fiction books were placed on a shelf to form the beginning of a small rental    collection.    The strict economy which curtailed book buying also had its effects on the    periodical list for the reading room. The list was carefully selected with regard    to what would be of most current interest and what would be most useful for    reference work later.    Except for the Horton Branch, there was little extension work. The chil­dren's    room could no longer supply the city and county schools with books;    the two little branches at the City Memorial and the County Tuberculosis    hospitals were still kept going-- but with cuts in service and books.    In 1933 came a red letter month, when, with aid from the Reconstruction    Finance Corporation, the interior of the building was painted and a cement    floor was laid in the stack room to provide security against the havoc formerly    wrought by termites. No wonder that a reporter during a thunderstorm on    July the second found Miss Berkeley and her assistants furiously wiping wind­driven    moisture from newly painted walls.    Library patrons responded cheerfully when, during the months of July    and August, the library instituted "" summer hours"" and closed at 6: 30 p. m.    instead of 9: 00, and the children's room closed during the lunch period in order    that summer vacations might be taken with a minimum of extra help and might    concur with the economy program launched by the city.    Readers who had to resort to rummage sales to aid family · finances; who    walked to' the library bec:; tuse no longer was bus fare jingling in their pockets;    and who drew in their belts several notches because the seven basic foods no    longer appeared on their dinner tables, cq. me as never . before to tax the reading    and reference facilities of the library.    Running comments gleaned from newspaper articles and the librarian's    reports indicate what these people wanted to know and to read:    September 1931: Few new books; classics are read. Favorite authors:    Bunyan, Dickens, Thackeray and Tolstoi. Increased interest in science, especially    the works of Einstein.    Not only within the walls of the Cherry Street library were the librarians    endeavoring to meet the needs of the patrons but to render service outside as    well. In February 1932 Miss Janet Berkeley and Rev. Douglas Rights, a member    of the Library Commission, attended a Grange meeting at Old Town School    and extended the hospitality of the library to the members present.    As Mr. E. F. Strupe, master of Old Richmond Grange of Forsyth County,    accepted in November 1955 a $ 10,000 award given to his Grange because it    was the winner of the nation's 1955 Community Service Contest, a letter is    herewith noted:    17",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1162,1162,1163.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1163.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dear Madam:    I have your letter of Feb. 24 in which you so graciously offer the use of a    set of books to our Grange for a period of time.    I will be in Winston- Salem Saturday afternoon- and I should like to bring    back with me the set, if you will please have them ready.    It is certainly a splendid offer you are making- and I hope we can make    use of your service, as part of our Grange lecture work from time to time- and    I believe we will, for it is certainly a worth- while service.    Very truly yours,    . E. F. STRUPE, Lecturer    Old Richmond Grange, 675    Without the constant support of the Library Commission, the crusading    spirit of the staff of the Journal and Sentinel, the generous donations of both    time and money by citizens and community groups, many of the things that    were accomplished would never have been possible. The Junior Chamber of    Commerce conducted a campaign for more books for the library in November    1932; and through the efforts of Mr. John Fries Blair, chairman of their com­mittee,    secured a number of new and worthwhile volumes. This committee    also sponsored a series of radio talks for the library during Book Week.    Mr. Owen Moon, publisher of the Journal and Sentinel, spearheaded the    newspapers' campaign to "" Help the Library.""    I I    A double column announcement in the Sentinel of Novembe. r 13, 1934 read:    I I, I    WILL YOU "" GIVE A BOOK""    ( OR BOOKS) TO THE    PUBLIC LIBRARIES    I    There is a sad lack of books avail:; tble to readers and for the purpose of    adding more books to the public libraries The Journal and Sentinel will conduct    a drive, not only to stimulate the giving of books, but to encourage our readers    to read more books. We urge those who may have books- any kind of books­which    they have read and do not now need- to send them to The Journal    Building, or give them to our carrier boy. He will bring the book to the    newspaper office, or the circulation department will collect the book or books.

Thi~ was    evident in speeches made by State leaders, members of the N. C. LIbrary    Commission and Mr. Meade H. Willis, Chairman of the Library Commission of    Winston- Salem. The annual reports of the librarian and the editorials of the    Journal and Sentinel evidenced discontent with existing facilities.    Salient factors pointed out were:    1. County Appropriations for Library Service, 1931/ 32    ( D. N. C. News Letter- October 26, 1932)    County Appropriation    1. Mecklenburg $ 10,000.00    2. Guilford 7,091.66 .    3.

American Library Association standards required that in a city of from    100,000 to 200,000 the library should have at least 2 books per capita and    that the minimum sum for which library service could be rendered was    one dollar per capita. In 1934 Forsyth County having a population of    111,681 was being served with a book collection of 25,558; less than one    fourth of a book per person, and less than 12¢ per capita.    3. The staff was issuing 30,000 hooks or more per assistant; the American    Library Association recommended 20,000 per assistant.    4. Appropriations for books had been:    1927 through 1929; more than $ 7,000 annually    1930/ 31: less than $ 4,000    1932/ 33: low of $ 1,457    1933/ 34: raised to $ 2,000    5.

Many organizations and individuals evidenced interest in the movement    for a new library building. The Junior Chamber of Commerce sponsored an    extensive drive for new quarters. The Mayor appointed a committee composed    of Mr. Meade H. Willis, chairman, and including Mrs. Thomas Barber, Rev.    Douglas Rights, Mr. Robert W. Gorrell and Mr. E. R. Linville; Mr. Hanselle    Hester, representing the Junior Chamber of Commerce's Librarv Project, nam~ d    Mr. Thomas E. Rice and Mr. Lawrence Watt to serve with the Mayor's com­mittee    to investigate library needs and to make definite recommendations for    satisfying these needs.    After studying the needs of the community and consulting with leading    library authorities of the country, the committee suggested $ 3.00 per capita as    a minimum amount for the construction of a central public library building. The    new library should provide for at least 150,000 books. The committee asked    that the Third and Cherry Street site with additional frontage on Third Street    be used. To finance the project it was recommended that the Board of Aldermen    proceed immediately to submit to the people the matter of voting bonds for    the new library.    In a November 1937 meeting the Board of Aldermen mapped a course for    the establishment of a $ 225,000 public library building. Consideration was    given to the questions of legal requirements, a bond issue election and the    general plan of the structure.    In 1938 an election was held to decide whether or not the city should issue    bonds in the amount of $ 225,000 for the erection of a new library building. The    bond issue was defeated by a vote against the registration.    The Horton Branch, however, fared somewhat better in the 30' s, at least    in securing a new rented home. In 1930 it was moved to a room at 216 East    Sixth Street which had formerly been a store. However, more space was again    needed as both children and grown persons were served from the same room.    Finally in February 1937 an adjoining room was secured, and the Horton    Branch celebrated its tenth anniversary by opening a separate room for chil­dren.    While the extra room was provided by the city, the Negroes themselves    agreed to be responsible for its furnishing, and the way they fulfilled their    promises was evidence of their appreciation of their own library and its librarian,    Mrs. Mary Hairston. Through the groups in their social clubs they gave a    charging desk, a dictionary stand, a globe, 2 tables, chairs and other useful    equipment for a library.    So ended the 30' s. This decade had seen many defeats but had witnessed    on January 10, 1931, the highest circulation of anyone day in the history of the    library- 1,327 volumes. It had seen the George Moses Horton Branch in 1930/ 31    lead all the Negro libraries in the State in total circulation.

( Miss Anne Carroll Moore, eminent children's librarian    from New York City, said in November 1933 that no other library in the United.    States had such an activity as broadcasting a children's story hour from the'    library itself to its credit.) . '.    In the spring of 1940 representatives of the Grange, 4- H clubs, home demon­stration    clubs, rural churches and the library met in the office of Mrs. Elizabeth    Tuttle, County Home Agent, to map plans for bookmobile service to Forsyth    County. A trial experiment was to be made for three months. The WPA was    to furnish a driver and the truck equipped with 2,000 books; the library was    to furnish 1,000 books and a staff member. After the County Commissioners    granted $ 75 for a three month period, the bookmobile began its regular schedule    on April 2, 1940, to 81 stops which included various schools, stores, service    stations and residences of the county. The bookmobile during this trial experi­ment    circulated 14,022 books, and registered 1,250 county borrowers.    Despite the interest and courageous efforts of a few county residents and    the Library Commission to retain the bookmobile service for the county the    Commissioners did not at this time agree to increase the appropriation for this'    purpose.    Good fortune, however, came to the library in a gift offered to the city ' by    Mr. James A. Gray in August 1941. Mr. Gray, in offering to purchase the    property on the southwest comer of West Fourth and Brookstown Avenue,    belonging many year~ to West End Methodist Church and at that time owned    by Centenary Methodist Church, specified no detailed use of the building but    expressed the hope that the city administration would find it practical to develop    at least a part of the property for a public library. .    On Sunday afternoon December 7, 1941, came the fateful news on the    radio-"" Japs Attack Pearl Harbor."" So again as in 1918, the library geared itself    to meet the wartime demands of its community. Already in 1940 with war    raging in Europe the public library, with National Defense in mind, had sought    to improve and strengthen its collection of technical books and to secure infor-    . mation concerning the different branches of service. To supplement service of    books and magazines the library, on being selected by the American Library    Association to serve as a War Information Center, received publications sent    out by the Office of Civilian Defense. .    Miss Berkeley, in a report, gave a description of conditions existing at that    time:    "" The first realization of the number of young men leaving to enter the    service came when books were found standing on the shelf of popular ' Westerns'    generally as bare as Mother Hubbard's cupboard. In fact the loss of so many    young people and the new and added responsibilities for our people caused    a decrease in book circulation. This is by no means peculiar to Winston- Salem    and Forsyth County.""    When the Victory Book Campaign was inaugurated in January 1942, a    special committee was appointed and the library was selected as the collection    center for the whole county. In the collection of these 4,432 books, the sorting,    packing and shipping, the librarian was assisted by v~ rious organizations.    As all WPA work was terminated in 1943 the library lost the helpful assist · ·    ance which it had obtained for the central library and the branch.    21",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1166,1166,1167.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1167.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ever popular and traditional story hours continued v be a regular    feature. Following the Christmas holidays the girls brought their favorite    dolls; and the boys, their favorite toys. They listened eagerly to stories featuring    dolls and toys and were also interested in the "" Hero Story Hours.""    ' In 1943 Miss Mary Gould Davis of the New York Public Library visited    Winston- Salem. She was sponsored by the Junior League for the purpose of    creating or reviving an interest in the art of story- telling. At the close of her    visit the Art Committee of the Junior League arranged to present the Children's    Department with all of the books on Miss Davis' recommended list.    Miss Anne Carroll Moore, well known author of children's books, under    the sponsorship of the elementary school librarians and the Children's Depart­ment    of the public library, was a speaker at the Book Week celebration in 1944.    Despite the many changes in home and community life that World War II    brought, the Adult Department maintained a state of normalcy. Military and    government agencies brought into the city many transients who tended to make    the reading public more cosmopolitan. Reading trends were toward more serious    type books such as Mein Kampf, and the percentage of non- fiction checked    out by borrowers increased. A vast interest in geographical and political ques­tions    was made evident by the reading of current periodicals, the numerous    reference questions and the demand for war books.    At various times during the fifteen years, 1930- 45, proposals had been made    to house the library in the Post Office building, to move it to the county court­house,    to build a new $ 225,000 building on the Cherry Street site, and to remodel    the former West End Methodist Church building. Winston- Salem during these    years had gotten more paved streets, hard- surfaced highways, playgrounds, a    new courthouse, a new city hall, a new city market building, a new Y. M. C. A.    building, a new union station, an extension of sewer lines and enlargement of    water works. As yet the small outmoded library had not found a new home.    COMMITTEE TO STUDY POST- WAR LIBRARY NEEDS    Many of the leading citizens and those who had been closely associated    with the cultural aspect of the city had voiced opinions and hopes that definite    steps would be taken by the city in the post- war period to improve libraries in    Winston- Salem. In March 1944 Mayor George W. Coan, Jr., named a committee    to make a study of the post- war needs of Winston- Salem as far as its library    was concerned. This committee was to make recommendations and formulate    plans for the future of Winston- Salem libraries. The committee was composed    of Mr. Irving E. Carlyle, Chairman, Mr. Meade Willis, Mrs. Nancy Martin, Mr.    Ralph P. Hanes, Mrs. W. F. Fansler, Mrs. Mary Reynolds Babcock, Mr. Ernest    Yarborough, Mrs. Melville Prongay and Rev. Douglas Rights.    The committee felt that it should give consideration to the following items    with regard to improved library facilities for all of the people of the community:    1. Character, site and location of a new central library building.    2. County- wide library service and a plan for joint participation in the . cost,    by both the city and the county.    22",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1167,1167,1168.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1168.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Establishment of branch libraries.    4. Devising a means for county- wide circulation.    5. More adequate building and enlarged service for the Negro population,.    6. The inadequacy of the law under which the library operated, and whether a._    vote of the people was necessary to legalize the appropriation for library ·    expense.    The committee went about the matter in a most business- like manner and    its first step was to obtain the services of a librarian who had had experien'ce in    administering both public and university libraries and a man who had made'    such surveys before. This man was Mr. Charles E. Rush, Librarian of the    University of North Carolina. Mr. Rush came to Winston- Salem in December'    1944 and conferred with city and county officials, members of the Library­Commission,    the librarian and other leading citizens.    COMMITTEE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS    Some of Mr. Rush's recommendations are mentioned. Under possibilities.'    and opportunities, "" Noted for its many progressive characteristics, Winston- ­Salem    offers exceptional possibilities for a renaissance of its library service and _    unique opportunitie!, for the provision of educational facilities to which the    community is entitled. In fact, such transformation may be accomplished here    so effectively that added distinction will be a prompt and outstanding result.    "" The geographical, industrial, financial and cultural conditions are highly ·    favorable in this community. This important commercial city, the trading center'    for a great area, located in one of the largest and wealthiest counties in the    State, should and can provide the best educational opportunities for its people,    and thus call further attention to its leadership. The modem American Public'    Library is a basic thermometer of a community's intellectual health, and it should    be the deep concern of Winston- Salem that every person in Forsyth County ·    shall he an informed, intelligent citizen, making utmost use of the best in print ·    for his continuing occupational, vocational and educational needs.""    The report which Mr. Rush submitted to the committee went on to say that    "" the library is destitute of many facilities, depleted in resources, lean in most of    its services. There are convincing evidences that the Library Commission and    the staff are fully aware of them. and for many years have struggled manfully    to meet them. However, the needs have grown too great to be met by ordinary    procedures. United community effort is imperative."" Some of the most important    and significant needs were listed as follows:    1. "" Fresh and sufficient book stock. The uresent holdings are drab and worn; ,    seriously deficient for present needs. Winston- Salem now should have over'    100,000 volumes ( instead of 34,0( 0), and 175,000 soon. Only $ 3,000 spent    annually for books for 126,000 people. Should be adding 18,000 volumes    ~ ach year instead of 2,100.    2. Normal financial income and appropriation. Present receipts are pitifully    below the minimum for first rate service~ Urgent need of $ 50,000 ( now    ""$ 17,( 00) which soon should be $ 100,000; nearer the $ 1.00 per capita    standard."" .

A functional structure, built with economy- without    waste in space and extravagant halls- and made distinctive and unique by the,    skillful use of light, color and line, was recommended. It was further suggested    that emphasis be placed on reader convenience, on administrath: e and operative    efficiency, and flexibility designed for further changes. Other factors to be    stressed were: physical comfort, protection of materials through mechanical    conditioning, acoustical treatment and the latest improvements in artificial    lighting. ' ,    It was noted previously that the planning committee set forth six points    for improving, and enlarging library service in Winston- Salem. These six points    were mentioned in Mr. Rush's report, with some elaboration and he suggested    other means of expanding and improving services, such as: more adequate    reference materials for research and information; the care and preservation of    valuable and, irreplaceable materials, such as early records, manuscripts, etc.;    increase in registered borrowers to nearer the standard of 30% of the popula­tion;    definite working program for near- future growth, development and­extension    of services, based on an officially approved program to obtain adequate    income and appropriations; change of official name to one which will more    _ nearly represent and include the city and county.    The report cited the "" logical steps in preparation"" for the services recom­-    mended. It can be said at this point that the report and recommendations    contained therein were readily and properly accepted, but they were not filed    away to gather dust. The report of the most inadequate library service of any    city in the State of comparable size apparently did not fall upon deaf ears. The    local newspapers published articles comparing Winston- Salem's book stock and    reading space with that of Charlotte, Asheville, Greensboro and Durham. It    pointed to the fact that in 1945 the library's per capita income was twelve cents,    not even the price of one admission to a movie. The local newspapers were    also calling attention to the fact that this was the time to give thought and make    plans for a new library building as a war memorial.    INITIAL GIFTS TOWARD' A LIBRARY    With all of the talk about plans for the future, the library was not even    holding it own in its outmoded building and with a womout book collection.    In 1945/ 46 there were more books discarded from the library than were added.    There were 1,563 volumes added and 1,689 volumes withdrawn. The library's    budget for complete maintenance for 1945/ 46 was $ 20,122, and of this the county    contributed $ 2,400. There were some bright spots beginning to show through    the overcast that had so completely encircled the library, and one of these    bright spots was the announcement by the Library Commission Chairman on    March 20, 1946, that the Junior League had made a gift of some shares of    stock, which when sold netted $ 7,400. This money was to be used for educa­tional    or promotional purposes as determined by the Commission. The Junior    League augmented the $ 7,400 by $ 1,800 which made a total fund of more than    $ 9,000. In 1946 the Board of Aldermen established a trust fund of $ 48,000    - toward a new public library building.

LIBRARIAN RETIRES AFTER 21 YEARS    On September 30, 1946, Miss Janet Berkeley retired as librarian after    twenty- one years of service. Miss Berkeley, as had her predecessors, struggled    in an effort to provide food for the intellectual appetites of the residents of    Winston- Salem against an apathetic public and officials who did not realize and    understand the real library needs of a growing industrial city. Miss Berkeley    had seen many changes in the twenty- one years since she came to Winston­Salem    from Norfolk, Virginia, but apparently the least change was in the li­brary.    There had been no change in the physical plant and year by year, even on    a meager book budget, the shelves became more and more crowded. Miss    Berkeley no doubt envisioned the day when Winston- Salem would have a new    library and more adequate service for its people.    Miss Berkeley was succeeded by Miss Jeannette Trotter. Miss Trotter had    filled the position of Assistant Librarian since May 1946. Miss Trotter came to    the public library in July 1944 from the Reynolds High School Library as a    cataloguer.    It was in late 1946 that the shelves became so crowded that it was necessary    to rent storage space in an adjoining building, and store about 5,500 volumes    of books. These books were available to the public but they had to be brought    from the adjoining building. There was such demand in the library for business    material that a business corner in the reference room was added where books    and magazines helpful to businessmen and executives were kept. It was noted    that after the war there was a decided change in the reading habits of the    patrons. Books of history and materials about the war were in lesser demand,    and there was greater demand for books on professions, vocations, avocations    and a great demand for scientific and technical books.    NEW LIBRARY COMMITTEE APPOINTED    In January of 1947 the movement for a new building was gaining momen­tum.    The Library Commission passed a resolution recommending that a com­mittee    representing the city, county and Library Commission be appointed by    the Mayor to investigate ways and means of financing and supporting a new    library building. Mr. Charles E. Rush was present at the meeting to give his    professional advice. In early February Mayor George Lentz appointed a com­mittee    composed of Mr. Ralph Hanes, Mr. Ralph Stockton, Mr. James G. Hanes,    Mr. W. K. Hoyt and Mrs. Bowman Gray.    In September 1947 a Gaylord charging machine was installed in the adult    department.

The charging machine simplified the    process by printing the number on the book card, and this was done by inserting    the borrower's card which had the number attached on a metal plate into the    charging machine. This new method of charging made for accuracy and speed    in the process of charging books. One person was able to do all of the book    charging, which released personnel to perform other duties.    Mr. Ralph Hanes appeared before the County Board of Commissioners    and told them that the library facilities in Winston- Salem were shameful in    comparison with facilities in other counties in the State. The need for greater    support was stressed by Mr. Hanes, and again the inadequate facilities, com­pared    with other cities of like size, were mentioned. The city was contributing    about $ 20,000 and the county $ 2,400. The State of North Carolina had passed    legislation in the early 40' s, and had been appropriating funds to help counties    extend library service to the rural and outlying areas. For almost six years after    State aid was made available, Forsyth County did not share in these funds    because there were certain requirements that had to be met. These requirements    were not being met because the county was not contributing the minimum of    funds to support the library program. In 1947, when the county did qualify for    State aid, and the library was able to obtain a bookmobile, it was estimated that    Forsyth County had lost about $ 12,000 in State aid over · the previous years    when it failed to qualify.    Mr. Hanes reported in 1947 to the County Commissioners that the Mayor's    Committee had drawn the following conclusions:    /    1. That neither a city or county bond issue for the purpose of building a library    was possible at that time.    2. That it was not the time to attempt solicitation of funds for an adequate    library building due to the other campaigns in progress.    3. It was felt that three or more years should elapse before an effort should be    made to raise funds for a library.    4. During the waiting period, the public should be informed of the need.    5. That adequate support of th~ present library be solicited from the county in    order that broader and better service be rendered, and that the inadequate    book collection be supplemented.    The county's contribution had remained $ 2,400 per year since 1939. The    county's contribution was increased in 1947/ 48 to $ 9,600.    In October of 1947 the North Carolina Library Association held its biennual    meeting in Winston- Salem. The visiting librarians expressed their surprise at    the inadequate library facilities for a growing industrial city the size of Winston­Salem.

From the first year of Mr.    Willis' appointment to the Library Commission, to the present time, he has    fought incessantly for better library service for the people of this community.    In 1938 Mr. Willis spurred the movement for a bond issue for a new library    building. The bond issue did not pass, but this did not deter Mr. Willis and    the few who were determined to continue the fight for better libraries. As a    banker, it was Mr. Willis' business to buy and sell securities for his bank, but    the toughest selling job that he had was to try to "" sell"" the county officials on    adequate and proper support of public libraries. The citizens of Winston- Salem    and Forsyth County should ever be mindful of the palt that Mr. Meade Willis    has played in the last forty years in seeing that the education of the people    of this community has continued beyond the period of formal schooling.    Mr. Willis was succeeded as Chairman of the Library Commission by Mr.    Ralph P. Hanes, who was appointed a member in early 1947. Mr. Hanes, a    successful business man and a civic minded citizen, has carried on, and is    carrying on the fight begun by Mr. Meade · Willis. Mr. Hanes' many accom­plishments    will be mentioned later.    LIBRARY SERVICE EXTENDED THROUGH BRANCHES    With an ever growing Negro population, the small quarters of the Horton    Branch could extend its services only so far. In 1947 service was extended to    the citizens in the Kimberly Park area, through a branch or deposit station    in the Kimberly Park Recreation Center. Soon after service was extended to    Kimberly Park, service was extended to the patients at Kate Bitting Reynolds    Memorial Hospital. In 1947, a "" Friends of the Library"" group was organized for    the purpose of stimulating interest in the branch library, and for promoting in­creased    library service among the Negro population.    In the Spring of 1948, through the efforts of the Lions Club of Kernersville,    a branch unit was opened in Kernersville. This deposit collection was kept · in    the store of Mr. W. S. Linville. The Kernersville deposit collection with the    one in Lewisville, which was opened Itwo years b~ fore, kept about 400 vQlumes    in circulation. The books in these deposit · collections were mqre readily acces­sible    to the people in these communities than the books in the main library,    since there was no bookmobile servi~ e at that time. ,: I. .

I    In 1948 there were a number of events that took place which encouraged    the members of the Library Commission' into thinking that the dark cloud was    b~ ginning to break.    GIFT OF BUILDING SITE    There was now approximately $ 95,000 from the West End Methodist    Church and the gift of the Junior League, toward a library building.

This property, 300' x 210', was to be used    for a new centr~ l library building. This' gift gave the Libr. ary Commission    renewed hope that a new Hbrary building was now on its way.    COUNTY QUALIFIES FOR STATE AID FUNDS    In late 1948 the city made application for State aid funds since it now    met the requirements set forth by the North Carolina Library Commission. In    this application the city requested funds with which to purchase a bookmobile.    It was expected that there would be seventy- seven bookmobiles in North    Carolina serving eighty- one counties by the end of 1948. However, Forsyth    would not be one of the Counties by that time.    During the early part of 1949 the bookmobile, which the city was purchas­ing    with State aid funds, arrived. The bookmobile was put into operation the    first of May. Much work had to be done in establishing stops and stations.    The home demonstration agent was most helpful in suggesting bookmobile    stops in the county. During the first month the bookmobile made 91 stops and    circulated 1,100 books. In addition to the 91 stops, there were 6 deposit stations,    The bookmobile, from its beginning until April 1954, served both the white and    Negro population. Each unit of the library operated the bookmobile for a period    of two weeks of each month, serving whites and Negroes separately, and with    librarians from the Horton Branch serving the Negroes and two persons from    the main library serving the white population.    During 1949 twenty- five clubs in Winston- Salem collected funds from their    members with which to purchase children's books for the children's room of    the Carnegie Library.    During the latter part of 1949 the city of Winston- Salem adopted a classifi­cation    and pay plan for all city employees. This plan meant an increased budget    and better salaries for all staff members of the library.    NEWSPAPER PUBLICITY STRESSING LIBRARY NEED    Perhaps the most significant step that turned the tide of community interest    toward new library facilities was the writing, by Mr. Pax Davis, of a number of    feature articles about the library. These articles appeared in the Winston- Salem    Journal and Sentinel in January 1950. Mr. Davis gathered facts from other    libraries in the State that were serving populations and population areas com­parable    to Winston- Salem and Forsyth County. He found that Forsyth had the    poorest library facilities of any of comparable size in the State, though it was    the wealthiest county in the State. Some other facts that Mr. Davis disclosed    were: Forsyth County had the fewest volumes of any of the seven counties of    comparable size; Forsyth had the smallest circulation of library volumes of any    of the seven counties; Forsyth had next to the lowest annual library appropria­tion    of any of the counties mentioned. These articles brought into final focus    the poor library facilities in Winston- Salem and the county and pointed out that    now was the time for action.    28",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1185,1185,1186.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1186.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hanes, the Chairman of the Library    Commission. Mr. Hanes quietly solicited his friends and some of the larger    corporations in Winston- Salem, and on January 24, 1951, he announced that    he had received gifts totaling $ 532,500 for new library buildings.' This gave    a total of $ 622,500 with the $ 90,000 given previously. These funds were    donated by the following individuals and organizations: Mr. W. N. Reynolds,    Mr. and Mrs. Charles H. Babcock, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Walker Bagley, Mr.    and Mrs. Robert M. Hanes, Mrs. Benjamin S. Bernard, Mr. and Mrs. Bowman    Gray, Mr. and Mrs. Gordon Gray, Mr. R. Thurmond Chatham, Mr. and Mrs.    Hugh G. Chatham, Mr. and Mrs. Richard T. Chatham, Jr., Mrs. Lutelle S.    \ iVilliams, Dr. S. D. Craig, Mr. and Mrs. Robert E. Lasater, Mr. and Mrs. P.

Reynolds To­bacco    Co., Hanes Dye and Finishing Co., Wachovia Bank and Trust Co.,    Piedmont Publishing Co., Hanes Hosiery Mills Co., P. H. Hanes Knitting Co.    Soon after the funds were pledged the Library Commission authorized    that Mr. Alfred M. Githens, a library building consultant, be engaged to begin    work on the plans for a new central building to be built on the site which Mr.    Richard J. Reynolds had given two years before. It was agreed that Mr.    Githens' initial fee would be paid from the sum which had been given to the    Library Commission by the Junior League in 1946.    It may be noted that the 1950/ 51 budget contained the largest item for    books that had ever been granted the library by the city. The amount was    $ 12;. 000. At this time the library had a book collection of 47,940 volumes, or ~~    of one book for each resident of the county, and the recommended standard    was two per person.    In April of 1951 Mr. Hanes spearheaded another campaign. This campaign    was to raise funds with which to purchase new books for the new library    buildings which were being planned. Much had been said about the inadequate    and worn book collection. It was intended that this library book fund would    greatly enlarge the book collection, so that a higher and much enlarged book    budget may be encouraged from the city when it again becomes the city's    responsibility to provide funds for books. There were more than 3,000 persons    within the entire county who participated in this campaign which netted pledges    of approximately $ 170,000.    CENTRAL BUILDING PLANNED    In late January 1951 Mayor Marshall Kurfees appointed Mr. Roy C.    Haberkern as Chairman of the Library Building Committee, with Mr. Ralph    P. Hanes, the Library Commission Chairman, as vice- chairman. Other members    named were: Mrs. Charles H. Babcock, Mr. James G. Hanes, Mr. Charles E.    Norfleet, Mr. Jack Shaffner and Mr. W. B. Simpson.    , '.• By the latter part of February, the total building fund had reached approxi­mately    $ 625,000.

The local newspapers have been given credit for keeping the library needs    before the people over the years. However, something very significant was noted    in the April 14, 1951, issue of the Winston- Salem Journal and Sentinel. In an    editorial entitled, "" Winston- Salem's New Public Library,"" it was stated that,    "" For more than a quarter of a century, the Editor of the Journal has been    writing editorials from time to time on the need for a new Public Library in    Winston- Salem. On January 3, 1926, and for twelve months thereafter, the    following editorial box was published daily at the top of the Journal's leading    editorial column:    THE JOURNAL'S 1926 PROGRAM FOR A BETTER WINS­TON-    SALEM.    - The Journal favors the following program of public improve­ments    for a better Winston- Salem in 1926.    . New Public Library . Wider streets    . A new Y. M. C. A. . A stadium    . A Municipal Park    Even then Winston- Salem had ' so far outgrown its Public Library building    and facilities that a new Public Library was placed first on the list of five    improvements advocated.    Mr. Alfred M. Githens had consulted with Mr. Charles E. Rush after having    been engaged to begin developing plans for the new library building. Plans' for    a three story structure were executed by Mr. Githens, and the working drawings    were being detailed by Northup and O'Brien, Arthitects. Mr. Hanes wanted    the expert opinion of the members of the American Library Association's    Library Building and Architecture Committee; therefore, he sent the building    plans to Chicago by Mrs. Nell Wright, Horton Branch Librarian. The American    Library Association was holding its annual meeting in Chicago in July. The    members of the Library Building and Architecture Committee and other li­brarians,    examined the plans and discussed them freely. The plans were returned    to the Library Commission Chairman with the suggestion that they be discarded    and that an active public librarian be engaged as a consultant. The suggestion    was accepted and Mr. Charles M. Mohrhardt, Associate Librarian of the Detroit    Public Library, was invited to come to Winston- Salem and work with the Li­brary    Building Committee in planning a building that would be more functional,    more practical and more economical to operate. After spending two days in    Winston- Salem, Mr. Mohrhardt gave the architects of Northup and O'Brien the    rough sketch of the building that was finally built.

It was felt that a director would spearhead the plans for    better library facilities after these plans were approved and formulated by the    Library Commission. In 1951, when it was assured that a new central library    building and improved facilities would become a reality, the city instituted the    position of Library Director, upon the recommendation of the Library Com­mission.    Paul S. Ballance was named the first Library Director, and he assumed    the position on November 1, 1951. Mr. Ballance had served as Librarian of the    Greensboro Public Library and the Texas A and M College Library, with ex­perience    also in the Rochester ( New York) Public Library and the New York    Public Library.    Miss Jeannette Trotter, who had served as librarian since 1946, was made    Associate Director in November 1951. It was during Miss Trotter's years as    librarian that much real activity took place toward larger and greater facilities.    While attention was being focused upon the library, more people visited the    library and availed themselves of all the services that were offered. Miss    Trotter and her staff not only deserve credit for carrying on in outmoded and    crowded quarters, but they merit . the thanks of the community for providing    the best service that could be provided with an exceedingly low operating    budget.    NEW BUILDING STARTED    The bids for construction of the new central library building were opened    on November 29. The low bidders were Fowler- Jones Construction Co. for the    general contract, with a figure of $ 309,684; Electric wiring contract, Colter and    Chappell, $ 52,525; Plumbing contract to Landingham Plumbing and Heating    Co., $ 18,100; Heating contract to Landingham Plumbing and Heating Co.,    $ 22,900; Air Conditioning contract to Air Conditioning Corp., $ 77,877; and    elevator installation, Westbrook Elevator Co., of Danville, Va., $ 9,804. All bids    totaled $ 490,890. The bids were approved by the Board of Aldermen about a    week later. The ground breaking ceremony took place on December 28, 1951.    Mr. Hanes was praised on this occasion by Mr. Haberkern and the'Mayor, both    stating that he had given unstintingly of his time and effort, and that he alone    was responsible for raising the necessary funds for the building and its equip­ment.    1 Mr. Hanes passed the credit for the job well done on to the donors of the    library building Ifund. The work of excavation on the building site began on    January I 2, 1952. Within a few weeks concrete forms were being placed, and    sbon to I follo\ v was the I Isteel framework. While activity was taking place on    West I Fifth Street, ' the libtary director and the staff at the old library were    se~ ving th~ ' public in more crowded quarters than ever, and at the same time    making plans for that long hoped for day of moving to the new quarters. During    the early stages of construction there were some minor changes made in the    interior plans, which it was felt would make for greater ease in operation. The    new building was planned with more than 38,000 square feet of space and a    book capacity of approximately 225,000 volumes. The new building had to be    equipped with everything from office equipment to library reading tables,    chairs, and special items of library furniture, such as charging desks, card    catalog units, magazine and newspaper racks and many other odd items.

During the latter part of 1951 the Executors of the Mr. \ V. N. Reynolds    Estate delivered to the library the book collection of Mr. Reynolds. It was    designated in Mr. Reynolds' will that his book collection constituting about    1,500 volumes be given to the library.    ESTABLISHMENT OF TRUST FUND    In February. of 1952 Mr. Ralph P. Hanes announced the establishment of    a trust fund to be known as the Lucy Hanes Chatham Fund, in memory of his    sister. This fund was endowed with 800 shares of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. B    Stock, valued at approximately $ 27,000, the fund to be administered . by the    Winston- Salem Foundation. Mr. Hanes specified that the net income from the    fund would be used to "" improve and add to the facilities of the Public Library    of Winston- Salem and Forsyth County in the following manner: The trustee    in its sole discretion shall from time to time purchase and/ or direct the purchase    of such books and/ or other articles for the library as will, in the opinion of the    trustee, contribute to the cultural, educational, recreational and/ or vocational    facilities of the library and/ or such articles as will, in the opinion of the trustee,    add to the beauty of the library building or its surroundings.""    At the time that Mr. Hanes announced this gift to the library, he suggested    that persons give books or funds for the purchase of books in memory of loved    ones rather than send flowers for the deceased.    MOVING PLANS BEING FORMULATED    During the latter part of February the library instituted two new regulations    looking forward to the day when the library facilities of both book stock and    reference material would be enlarged and in greater demand. The practice of    charging circulating books for 14 days, with the privilege of renewal, was    changed; and all books, except new and popular books, were to be charged. for    28 days, with no renewal privilege. New and popular books were to be charged    for 14 days, with no renewal privilege, instead of 7 days. This new practice    eliminated the matter of renewing books by telephone, which required almost    half the time of one assistant. It had been the practice to circulate the back    issues of magazines. This practice had deprived the library of a valuable source    of reference material. Many times when a magazine was needed to answer a    reference question, it was found to be in circulation. Furthermore, many maga­zines    were lost in circulation and many were torn and mutilated. In order that    the library might have complete files of magazines for reference purposes, it    w?,; decided that the practice of circulating magazines would be discontinued,    an] that the most used magazines would be bound for permanent use.    In February of 1952 the Mayor named six persons to serve as an Advisory    Building Committee to the Horton Branch Library. Mr. D. W. Andrews,    was named to head the Committee. Other members appointed we~ e: Mr.    Leander Hill, Mr. Curtiss Todd, Rev. W. R. Crawford, Mrs. Berlan ' Williams    32-",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1189,1189,1190.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1190.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

D. Malloy, with Mrs. Nell Wright and Mr. Ralph Hanes as ex­officio    members. The advisory committee was to have the responsibility of    selecting a site on which the new branch library would be erected. The group    would work with the library building committee. It was expected that there    would be sufficient funds available in the approximately $ 800,000 raised in 1951    for building purposes to also build and equip a branch.    . The Library Commission requested an operating budget of $ 89,211 for the    year 1952/ 53. This budget included increased items for maintenance of the    new building for part of the year. I~ included also increased items for supplies    since the library would be operating in much enlarged quarters with an in­creased    staff. The item for salaries must be increased since six new staff mem­bers    were requested. A total budget increase of $ 20,534 over the previous year    was approved by the Board of Aldermen.    In 1952 the North Carolina Library Commission allocated $ 500 to each of    the first ten public libraries that could qualify as participants in an adult film    program. These libraries had to agree to provide projection equipment, provide    space for previewing and showing films and to make the films available to    organized groups in the community. This library qualified in the program and    sixty films were purchased the first year for the ten libraries. These films were    block booked so that each participating library would have six films each month.    This project, which began in September, put the Public Library of Winston­Salem    in the film business. During the nine months of the first year the library    booked 170 showings, and these films were seen by 6,000 persons.    In 1952 the public library participated in the "" American Heritage"" discus­sion    series, sponsored by the American Library Association and financed by the    Fund for Adult Education, an agency of the Ford Foundation. The discussion    meetings were held in the Horton Branch Library the first year that the library    was officially a participant.    The inadequacy of the library's book collection was more forcibly impressed    upon the librarians when they began checking authorized lists and bibliogra­phies    against the library's holdings. In almost every subject field the library    possessed only a small portion of the standard titles recommended for libraries    in cities the size of Winston- Salem. Hundreds and thousands of titles were    selected from lists and bibliographies. Orders for these books were placed in    the laUer months of 1952, so that some of these new books might be catalogued    and available when the new building was opened. It was not possible to do    this, however, because in the process of assembling the old collection and    performing the thousand and one tasks necessary before moving, neither space    nor staff was available to catalog books.    In further preparations of moving day, librarians had been working for    months in the storage room sorting and culling books. Hundreds of volumes    were not worth moving to the new building because of their physical condition,    and others contained old and obsolete information. It was decided that these    old, obsolete and worn books would be given to the public, free for the taking.    It was interesting to note that several thousand books were "" carted"" away in    two days.    33",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1190,1190,1191.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1191.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The equipment contractors, suppliers and the    decorators were ready to move in and perform the final tasks before the books    were moved.    The members of the Junior League voted to assist the library in promoting    the work in the children's room for a period of three years. The League agreed    to allocate approximately $ 1,500 each year to assist the library in purchasing    phonograph records, juvenile film, and other media of library service. The    League further agreed that its members would volunteer to perform jobs and    tasks in the children's room so assigned by a committee. It also agreed to    contribute approximately $ 500 yearly towards renting art exhibits.    On March 7 the old Carnegie Library building closed its doors after having    served the community for over forty- seven years. The staff began the mammoth    task of packing and labeling thousands of books, magazines and newspapers    and having these transported to the new library where they would be arranged    in order on the new and gleaming shelves.    DEDICATION OF NEW BUILDING    On March 26 the public was given its first look at the new library quarters.    The new library was dedicated on that day with persons from far and near    taking part in the ceremonies. It was fitting that Mr. Charles E. Rush should    make the principal address. Mr. Rush made the first survey for improved    library s, ervice in 1944.    Thousands of persons could actually say that they had a part in the realiza­tion    of a dream, because these persons contributed either toward the building    fund or the library book fund. .    No more fitting tribute could be paid the library staff than was paid them    in an editorial of March 10, 1953, in the Winston- Salem Journal and Sentinel:    "" The able library staff which this city has been fortunate to have through the    years will be able- and happily so- to extend their worthwhile efforts in the new    institution.""    Mr. Ralph P. Hanes has championed the cause for better libraries and    better library service throughout Forsyth County since he became a Commission    member. Mr. Hanes single- handedly raised sufficient funds for the construction    of a central library and a branch. He started the movement for a library book    fund, in order to supplement the book collection. Mr. Hanes continued his    interest from the day the first shovelful of earth was turned, until the last book    was put in its place on the shelves the day before the dedication of the central    building. His interest has continued through subsequent events in providing    better and more complete library service to the citizens of Forsyth County. No    doubt, one of the greatest pleasures that has come to Mr. Hanes was to provide    books and art treasures in an atmosphere where they may be enjoyed and    appreciated most, by all who visit the library. This has been done by providing    an art gallery in the central library below the area where the art books are    34",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1191,1191,1192.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1192.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr. Hanes keeps abreast of the needs of the modem public library and    exerts his influence constantly in seeing that Winston- Salem goes forward in    providing good and adequate service for its citizens.    DESCRIPTION OF CENTRAL BUILDING    It may be well to mention some of the physical features of the building    that makes it a functional building. The total cost of the building including    equipment and furniture was $ 620,143. The building is 182 feet long by 82    feet wide, containing 38,205 square feet of space. There is a sub- basement    where the heating land part of the air conditioning equipment is housed. The    penthouse houses some of the air conditioning equipment. The exterior of the    building is finished with Indiana Oolitie limestone, with chat- sawed finish. Both    entrances are trimmed with polished Minnesota granite. The windows are    large, full length, in the reading room on the north and west sides: The windows    in the Children's Department and work areas are of a smaller type. All windows    are double- glazed. The building is a good example of modular type construc­tion,    where the strength of the building is in the exterior walls and interior    pillars, well spaced. All interior walls are of hollow cinder block and are    painted. The walls in the stairwell leading from the main Hoor to the ground    floor are plastered, except for a five foot wainscot, which is covered with Vinyl    plastic material. The walls in the rest rooms are plastered above a tile wainscot.    The main reading room and children's room is lighted by 4' x 4' recessed    fluorescent fixtures, each unit containing six deluxe warm white slimline lamps.    The fixtures in the office area are the same recessed type except that the lamps    are standard warm white streamlined, all having eggcrate baffles to reduce    direct glare. The stack area on the main Hoor is equipped with recessed fluores­cent    troffers in continuous runs, running lengthwise the stacks, equipped with    8' slimline lamps; these also have eggcrate baffles. The lighting fixtures on the    ground floor, the stacks, and the Extension Department, are suspended fluores­cent    units, with hinged baffle louvres, with closed top and metal sides. The    areas between stacks on the ground floor are equipped with incandescent lamps    with metal reflectors, which give adequate illumination on the bottom shelves.    The auditorium is equipped with recessed slimlille troffers, 4' long with    hinged glass lens panels. In other areas on the ground floor are recessed incan­descent    fixtures, with glass bottom lens in hinged frame.    The floors on the main level are rubber tile, of a mottled brown; on the    ground level they are asphalt tile in mottled green in the stacks, and mottled    gray in other areas.    The ceilings are of two types: in the reading room mineral acoustical tile    ( Travertone) forms a suspended ceiling; in the office area and areas on the    ground floor there is a suspended ceiling of perforated fibre material ( Cushion­tone    ).    ne air conditioning unit has a maximum capacity of 111 tons every 24    hours; that is, it makes 111 tons of ice, or melts that amount of ice. The blowers    which supply the building with air have a capacity of 45,000 cubic feet of air .    per minute, or a complete change of air every 10- 12 minutes.

The penthouse contains the exhaust and filtering equipment, while the com­pressor    and chilled water equipment is in the basement. All controls for the    operation of the blowers and air conditioning equipment are on the main floor,    within easy access. The building is heated with two gas- fired hot water heating    boilers, connected and valved so that either one or both can serve the system.    Fin tube radiators are provided under all window areas to act as boosters in    extreme weather. Hot air is distributed through ceiling louvres when heat is    needed, and cold air is distributed from these same louvres in hot weather.    The principal library activities are on the main floor, with the whole area    to the right of the main entrance comprising the main reading room which is    approximately 110' x 90'. In this room are installed steel free- standingstacks    on the south side, with a~ book capacity of about 40,000 volumes. At the    far end of the stacks at the west end are located four individual study rooms,    made by "" Mobile- steel"" walls, each equipped with a desk and shelves. These    rooms may be assigned to persons doing research and the rooms may be locked    The center area in this room is equipped with round and rectangular reading    tables, and miscellaneous furniture. The reference and information desk is    located at the end toward the entrance, in front of the stacks and near the    public catalog. Wood shelves are arranged on the west wall and in the areas    between the north windows. The area on the north side of the reading room is    divided into three alcoves for popular reading materials, by counter- height    shelves, backed with periodical racks containing the current periodicals.    At each end of the reading room are browsing' areas with comfortable,    overstuffed furniture. The reading room has an over- all seating capacity of    about 100. The main circulation desk is located directly in front of the main    entrance and at the extreme east end of the reading room.    The Children's Department is to the left of the entrance, separated from    tb0 adult area by a glass partition. This room has seating accommodations for    20- 30 children. The Children's Department is equipped with a listening table    for records, similar to the one in the main reading room for adults. Directly    back of the main circulation desk are two offices: the workroom for circulation    desk personnel and the children's librarian, and the room for audio- visual    materials, records, films and filmstrips. Beyond the circulation desk from the    main entrance, to the left, is the business office and pr: ocessing department.    . i    The ground floor has an entrance on 4~ street, and may also be reached    by a stairway from the main floor. To the' left of this entrance is an exhibit    room.~ Off this room are two small meeting rooms accommodating 20 and 25    persons, respectively. At the far end of the exhibit room is the I entrance to the    auditorium which has a seating capacity for approximately 135 persons. This    room has a small stage. Each room in this area is equipped with portable    spotlights for spotting art works. The walls are treated with "" Fab- rik- o- na,""    a burlap type material mounted on ; 14"" plywood, so that hangings may be fas­tep':    Jd to the walls without marring them. The largest room on the ground floor    is the main stack room, with a possible capacity of 165,000 volumes. At the    extreme east end of the building opening on the ground level is the garage,    with . a loading dock platform.    The garage has a ramp so that book trucks may be rolled down to the    bookmobile. Two rooms open off the garage.

This area is used for making posters, photographing books and    library materials, and performing similar jobs. The other room is the receiving    and shipping room. Opening off the extension room is a hall leading to staff    quarters which include staff rest rooms and a staff lounge with combined    kitchenette and a small dining room. A stairway from this hall leads into the    business office area. At the end of the hall is the audio- visual workroom.    The reading rooms, both adult and children's, are furnished with limed oak    tables of apronless design, furnished by Myrtle Desk Company, High Point,    N. C. The wood chairs for the readings rooms were manufactured by the High    Point Chair and Bending Company, Siler City, N. C. In the main reading room    there are arm chairs for the round tables and straight chairs for the rectangular    tables. All chairs have upholstered backs finished in two shades of brown, green    and yellow leather. The chairs in the children's room are finished in red and    green leather, with bent wood chairs to match the round Formica- top tables    from Thonet, Inc., in red and gray.    The comfortable chairs in the reading room were supplied by Erwin­Lambeth    Company, Thomasville, N. C., and Thonet, Inc., Statesville, N. C.    There are some miscellaneous items of furniture by Van Keppel- Green Com­pany,    Los Angeles, California. The office furniture is all metal with linoleum    tops, supplied by Globe- Wernicke Co., and the steel stacks were supplied by    Virginia Metal Products Company.    The color schemes for all areas were done by a decorating committee with    the assistance of Dan Cooper of Dan Cooper, Inc., New York. Mr. Cooper and    the committee selected the draperies and the comfortable furniture and rugs.    The warm soft colors used by Mr. Cooper throughout the building are generally    admired.    A self- operating elevator, for staff use only, serves the two floors. The ground    floor stacks are closed to the public..    The library uses a Recordak, Jr., for charging; and all books, both adult and    juvenile, are charged and returned at the main circulation desk.    EAST WINSTON BRANCH PLANNED    In April of 1953 shortly after the new central library was opened, it was    announced that a site for the new Negro branch library was being offered the    city by Dr. J. C. Jordan, Dr. H. D. Malloy and Dr. H. R. Malloy. The site was    on the southeast corner of the intersection of East Seventh Street and Woodland    Avenue, directly opposite the Kate Bitting Reynolds Memorial Hospital. The    lot had a frontage of 150' on East Seventh Street and 50' on Woodland    Avenue. The lot was accepted by the city after it was rezoned. The city    purchased the adjoining lot which extended 150' on East Seventh Street and    100' deep on Cleveland Avenue. The price paid for the lot was $ 12,000.    The firm of Northup and O'Brien ( later changed to Lashmit, James, Brown and    Pollock) drew the plans for the branch. The building was to be a functional    unit designed along lines similar to those of the central library.    Mr. Roy C. Haberkern was appointed by the Mayor to head the Library    Building Committee.

Norman, Rev. W. R. Crawford, Dr. H. R. Malloy, Mr. Curtiss    Todd and Rev. Kenneth Williams.    In 1953 the Horton Branch Library was accorded two honors. The first    was an honor medal presented by the Freedoms Foundation for the library's    "" American Heritage Project."" The project was conducted in the Branch Library    since the Carnegie Library did not have facilities for the meeting before the    new central building was completed. The other honor was a special award for    its work with community groups. The award was given in the John Cotton    Dana Publicity Awards Contest sponsored by the Wilson Library Bulletin.    The final plans for the branch library were approved in the late summer,    and the bids were opened in early November. The total bids were $ 121,747,    with $ 77,000 for general construction, and other bids as follows: Brownlow's    Inc., plumbing, $ 5,888; Brownlow's, Inc., heating, $ 1,965.39; Carolina Air Con­ditioning    Co., air conditioning, $ 19,400; Colter and Chappell, electric wiring,    $ 6,204; Electric lift, Ace Elevator Company of Charlotte, N. C., $ 6,204.    The old library building and site was sold for $ 65,000. This amount was    added to the building fund. Ground was broken for the new branch library in    late December. This branch was to be known as the East Winston Branch    Library.    INCREASED USE OF LIBRARY SERVICES    When the year 1953 ended the citizens of Winston- Salem and Forsyth    County had been using their new central library for nine months. All services    in the library continued to increase month by month. The number of persons    using the reading rooms doubled; there was now sufficient space for all to come    and read and study. The library had acquired a collection of 33 rpm phonograph    records and many 78' s were given to the library. These records were made avail­able    for circulation on November 10. The library had also acquired some film of    its own and these were available for circulation. The library's meeting rooms    were available for use by organizations who might make application to use    them. The library had four art exhibits in its gallery. An enlarged story hour    had been in effect since the new building opened. By the end of 1953 the    library was cataloging and placing 1,200 volumes of books on its shelves each    month.    In 1954 the greatest problem that faced the library in its new quarters was    to provide the public with reading material and other services. The library    was now cataloging more than 1,200 books per month, but this was not fast    enough to satisfy Winston- Salem's book appetite.    The library had received much publicity through articles- in national and    state journals, and its visitors were from many states and a number of foreign    countries. The library was honored to have Mr. S. Mohlenbrock, the Librarian    of the Public Library of Norrkoping, Sweden, to spend three days in Winston­Sal    em inspecting the public library and becoming familiar with American    library practices.    In early 1953, even before the central library opened, many persons were    continually calling and asking if they could give books to the library. It was    decided that gifts would not be accepted until some of the newly purchased    books could be catalogued and made ready for circulation. Many persons sent    38",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1195,1195,1196.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1196.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several gave funds and requested that any needed books be pur­chased.    Among the gift books that were presented to the library were tWo small    but valuable collections. One was the collection of Mr. Pierson Ricks, given    by his family, and the other was a collection of architectural books given by    Mr. Leet A. O'Brien, retired architect. Also a collection of books that had    belonged to Mr. R. E. Lasater was . given by his family.    ,    EXTENSION DEPARTMENT ORGANIZED    In April 1954 the library received its new traveling library, or bookmobile.    This bookmobile had a capacity of 1,800 books and would be used to greatly    expand book service to the rural residents of the county.    The Extension Department was established at the beginning of the fiscal    year 1954/ 55. The head of this department would hold equal rank with other    department heads and would have supervision over all the activities of rendering    service to the rural areas and some of the housing projects within the city. All    bookmobile stops were re- examined and new schedules were worked out. The    bookmobile was scheduled to make white and Negro stops on the same run.    During the early fall of 1954 a unified registration. system was instituted.    This meant that a patron could register at any unit, central library, East Winston    Branch or on the bookmobile, and his registration card would be honored at    either unit. In order to prevent duplication of registration, a central or master    registration file is maintained at the central. library.    EAST WINSTON BRANCH IN OPERATION    The new East Winston Branch Library was dedicated on November 14,    1954, less than one year after work began on the building. Mr. L. Quincy    Mumford, Librarian of Congress and a native of North Carolina, delivered the    principal address.    The description of this branch library follows. The building is of brick    construction with Indiana limestone trim. The building is 141' 8"" long with a    depth of 43' 4"" on the east side. The west end reduces to a depth of 32'. The    entire building occupies an area of 7,453 sq. ft., with 5,813 sq. ft. on the main    floor and 1,64Q , sq. It. in tre basement. The total cubage of the building is    93,011 cu. ft. .    I    The general plan of the branch, follows very much that of the central    library, with all of the activities l( jIn the main floor. Due to the contour of the    land and the nearness to the surface of a main sewer line under the building    it was not possible to have the main floor at street level. However, instead of    having the six steps in one sequence, they were broken by having two steps    from the street to a small lobby and four steps from the lobby to the main    , entrance to the reading room.    The adu"" lt reading room occupies the east portion of the building and is    67' long and 43' wide for a distance of 32', graduating to 27' wide. To the right    of the entrance is a sInall area furnished with comfortable furniture and around    the . walls, counter height, are the magazine cases for current periodicals.

This room is furnished with    four round tables and two rectangular tables with a sloping top table for study.    There is also a rectangular table with two record players equipped with ear­phones    for listening. The area at the extreme east end of the room is arranged    as a comfortable reading area with comfortable furniture. A portion of the    north wall has wood shelves and it is here that the popular books are shelved.    This room will seat forty people. The main room houses about 10,000 volumes    of books in steel free standing shelves at the rear area. The work office and    the librarian's office are immediately back. of the charging desk. To the left    of the office is a small storage and workroom, with an outside entrance for the    staff. The automatic lift which gives access to the basement opens off this    workroom.    To the right of the charging desk is the children's room, with the librarian's    desk, card catalog and vertical file near the entrance. This room contains six    round tables of two sizes, and one double, sloping top table and a rectangular    listening table with two record players. This room will seat about 35 children.    There are wood shelves around all of the wall area in the room, with three    double- faced free standing sections at the west end. At the rear of the chil­dren's    room is a hall, extending the full length of the children's room. The    southeast end of the hall opens to the rear of the building and on the parking    lot which has space for 15 cars. The west end of the hall opens into the audi­torium.    The public restroom~ are off the hall. The auditorium is 32' x 26' and    will seat about 100 persons. The room is equipped so that it may be used as an    exhibit gallery, with spot lights, and the walls covered with Fab- rik- o- na for    hanging exhibit material. The auditorium has an entrance from the street.    There is a small stage with storage rooms on either side.    The basement is divided into three areas: the staff area, which consists    of a combination lounge room and kitchen unit, and an adjoining restroom;    the stack area, with stacks having a capacity of about 18,000 volumes of books;    the mechanical room, which houses the heating and air conditioning equipment.    This library, like the central library, is easy to supervise because of large    open areas and no solid walls. Glass is used generously for partitions, which    make supervision easy. The interior walls of the building are of concrete block,    painted. The ceilings throughout are of pedorated fibre tile material. All    floors are of asbestos Vinyl plastic. The building is lighted by 24"" x 48"" recessed    fluorescent fixtures, with eggcrate baffles to reduce direct glare. The building is    heated by a gas fired hot water boiler, with heat exchangers in the ducts pro­ducing    warm air which circulates through vents and louvres. The air condi­tioning    units are of 20 and 10 ton capacities; the larger controls the main library    proper and the smaller controls the auditorium.    Much has been said about the small and inadequate book collection in the    public libraries; and this collection, as was mentioned earlier, shrank consider­ably    just before being moved to the new building. Within the three years that    the central library has been occupied the bock stock has grown for the whole    sy: tem from 54,000 volumes to approximately 90,000 volumes as a net collection.    During this period several hundred volumes have been discarded.    The operating budget for the public library system has enlarged from    $ 68,677 in 1951/ 52 ( the year before the central library was opened) to a cur­rent    budget of $ 140,673, exclusive of an item for books. It is expected that    approximately $ 30,000 will be spent from the special library book fund.    40-",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1197,1197,1198.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1198.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C. Buxton, Rev. Douglas Rights, Mr.    Meade Willis, Mr. Ralph Hanes and others have had in bringing improved    library service to this community.    The City of Winston- Salem is now in possession of two of the finest library    buildings in the State and even in the South for that matter. These libraries    are well on their way to being stocked with books "" and other materials which    will satisfy the public needs, if they are maintained and staffed in accordance    with good library standards. Does the public know that our State Constitution    does not recognize the public library as a necessary service in North Carolina    and therefore ad valorem tax money cannot be used for its support. This means    that the people of any county must vote a tax for the support of libraries before    they may be maintained by tax funds. Otherwise, libraries are maintained    with non- tax revenues, such as fines, fees, etc. If your Library Commission is    to continue to operate your libraries by requesting a budget each year from    the city with the help of the county, there can be no assurance of continuing    adequate funds. If a tax rate is set as a result of the vote of the people, and    this rate based upon the valuation of county property, the Library Commission    is sure to have a certain amount each year with which to maintain libraries.    The amount of money will increase each year as property values increase, and    as the library needs increase.    This is the only sure means that the citizens have that their libraries in    Winston- Salem and Forsyth County will be maintained in as stable a manner    as their schools.    It appears that before the end of 1956 the city will have annexed or ex­tended    the city limits to include several square miles and quite a few thousand    persons. It is expected that there will be areas within the city limits that are    three or four miles from the center of the city. All of the people who will be    included in the enlarged city will require library service. The time is now at    "" hand when the Library Commission should be giving some thought to the    establishment of branch libraries within the city. At the present time we have    only one branch and that is in East Winston, built principally to serve the    Negro population. It is safe to say that neighborhood branch libraries are    almost a must in cities of over 100,000 population; however, local conditions    many times make a difference. Branch libraries are usually neighborhood    centers and it is to these libraries that patrons go for their recreational and    light reading. The central library would remain the reference center, or focal    point, for research and informational materials and special services such as    film~, records, etc. It may also be stated that the time is at hand when con­sideration    should be given to the establishment of branch libraries in the larger    areas of population in the county.    This is not the time for the citizens and library leaders to relax their efforts    for continued and better library service for all in Forsyth County. Within the    past ten years this city and county has moved from the bottom to the position    of second among the larger cities and counties of the State in library service.    This position has been attained through hard work for a few people, but let the    people of Winston- Salem and Forsyth County continue their stride and win    first place. After first place is attained, may it be maintained.    41",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1198,1198,1199.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1199.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has attempted    to increase the number of people receiving library service    in the community by the quality of the program it pre­sents.    The purpose of this booklet is to show a few of the    ways by which the library hopes eventually to reach its    maximum usefulness in the community and become a    leading educational, recreational, cultural and social insti­tution    in this community. The ultimate aim of the    Horton Branch Library is to become an integral part of    the whole community.    1",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1205,1205,1206.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1206.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long before four o'clock each Tuesday    afternoon, in fact, as soon as the classes at school are dismissed the little ones start gath­ering    at the library. There are children rummaging through the first, second, third,    and fourth grade book shelves- some selecting books to take home after story hour is    over and others looking at pictures. Other children, stimulated by their teachers, are    seeking information, as many others ask for the two Viewmasters in order to enjoy a    "" Make Believe Journey"" around the world or spend a few minutes of their time with    favorite Western heroes.    The slogan "" It pays to advertise"" has been made the basis of a promotional program    for the younger boys and girls. As a first step the librarians visited grades one, two    and three in the several schools of the community. The principals and teachers co­operated    in arranging a program which included talks made to pupils about the library    and what it has to offer and a field trip to the library by whole classes. At the time of    the visit to the library the boys and girls are given application cards which entitle them    to become members of the library if the parents' and teachers' signatures are secured.    Also, they are shown our most attractive books and are encouraged to use with proper    care the books that are here for the asking. By means of advertising the story hour has    almost outgrown the library.    Our Audio Visual department has several sets of "" Young America Films"" and each    set contains six stories done in rich, full colorful art work by leading illustrators of chil­dren's    literature. The children have seen the filmstrips over and over again at the va­rious    story hours but never seem to tire of them. Each week they make requests for    strips to be shown the next time. The requests cannot always be at the time desired but    are put on memo for future use.    At scheduled intervals, full length films such as "" Alice in Wonderland,"" "" Treasure    Island"" and "" Heidi"" are shown on the library's 16mm projector. Weeks in advance the    children look forward to this feature and come with little brothers and sisters and friends    to give the library a "" Standing Room Only"" capacity.    The Story Hour attendance averages 44 children per story hour. The total at­tendance    at story hour this year to date has been 527. At the end of each story hour    semester ( which coincides with the school semester), the children are entertained in    some way. Usually in June there is a picnic scheduled at one of the recreation centers    in the community.    We are looking forward to a new library where more children can be accommodated.    With films, records, stories and games, the Story Hour at Horton Branch Library    will be the talk of the town.    3",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1207,1207,1208.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1208.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each week five or six new books are introduced to the children    by telling them interesting parts of the stories ( just enough to make them have the de­sire    to read the books). The titles are stressed in order that the children may ask spe­cifically    and intelligently for the books they want.    During the summer months many boys and girls join the Bookland Reading Club.    This club was organized for the purpose of stimulating an interest in the reading of good    books while on vacation. Many boys and girls from the story hour group become mem­bers    of the Reading Club. Thorough reading and neatness are encouraged by the libra­rian    and the boys and girls are given the opportunity to tell each other interesting features    about the books they have read.    4,2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1208,1208,1209.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1209.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of such an organized group, with bi- monthly meetings, is not only for    guidance in the selection of purposeful and lei ure time reading of good literature, but    also as a clearing house of information through the media of discussion groups. Topics    of particular interest and immediate concern to these teen- agers such as photography,    careers, etc., have been discussed since the initial meeting.    Interested citizens in the community, engaged in various occupations, have served    as discussion leaders and have given the teen- agers first hand information and advice con­cerning    their respective careers. Books, pamphlets and magazines on subjects and ca­reers    being discussed are displayed.    It is felt that such an organization answers the need for purposeful leisure time ac­tivity    for this important age group and reemphasizes the fact that the public library    is not only a book dispensary but an educational, recreational and cultural center of the    community.    6",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1210,1210,1211.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1211.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The American Heritage Project had its beginning in July 1951 when the Fund for    Adult Education of the Ford Foundation made a grant of $ 150,000 to the American Li­brary    Association to be used for "" the promotion and demonstration of adult community    discussion groups on the background of our American Heritage and its contemporary    application, to be undertaken by means of a continuing program through the agency of    public libraries.""    The American Library Association felt that these discussion groups could contribu~ e    to the understanding and strengthening of our heritage by giving the average citizen : l    chance to examine his heritage and decide what it stands for, to realize where we have    achieved the dream of our forefathers, where we have failed and what we might do    about the failures. These discussions were to provide an opportunity for renewal of    democratic faith- a confidence that the foundations of our national life have both the    strength and flexibility to be translated into meaning for the present so that our demo­cratic    principles may fit our greatly changed conditions.    A group of citizens, cooperating with the staff of the library, planned six discussion    groups that might be adapted to our local interests and needs. This planning committee    was composed of Rev. Joseph Patterson, J. T. Diggs, Jr., Rev. J. D. Peterson, A. A.    Miorisey, W. A. B. lount, Dr. Lillian Lewis, Mrs. A. A. Morisey and Mrs. E. E. Balsley.    Specific contributions were made by Mrs. Belle McCorkle, Dr. P. M. Brandon, and Chester    S. Davis.    The topics used in the discussion groups and the films shown are listed as follows:    "" Some Elements of European Thought in Our Bill of Rights,"" Film: Bill of Rights­""    Technological Advance and Cultural Lag in America,"" Film: Was/ age of Human Re­sources-""    Civil Rights, Rights of Minority Groups, Human Rights"", Film: The Chal­lenge-""    Our North Carolina Heritage,"" Film: Tarheel Family-"" Does It Matter What    You Think?"" Film: Does It Matter \'(' hat Ymt Think?-"" Our Moral and Political Re­sponsibility    in a Free Society,"" Film: It's Your America.    There was an average atendance of thirty- three at each evening meeting. However,    the success of the project cannot be measured solely in terms of the number of persons    who attended. The citizens who attended represented an interesting cross- section of    community life and many who attended either work with or are connected with groups    in the community representing varied interests. Some of the discussions were recorded    and parts of them were broadcast by a local radio station. Some of the films used were    shown to local groups before being returned to the American Library Association.    13",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1217,1217,1218.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1218.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the contest is "" to commemorate George Washington Carver,"" inter­nationally    known Negro scientist and educator; to encourage young people to do re­search    in "" the contributions of the Negro to American civilization and culture""; and    to stimulate and encourage "" creative writing among the youth of this community.""    The opening date for the contest is in January around "" Carver Day"" and the contes­tants    usually have six weeks in which to mail their papers to the library. The first two years    of the contest, the contestants wrote on the life of Carver. Since then other scientists    and educators have been chosen for the subject. This year elementary students wrote    on the subject, "" Carter G. Woodson, the boy""; high school students, "" Woodson, the    youth""; and college students, "" Woodson, the young man and historian.""    Citizens in the community are chosen as judges, and awards are presented to the    winners by personal contributions made to the committee by Friends of the Library and    interested groups. This year, for the first time, awards were presented to the winners    of those in second place.

The second Sunday in November, 1947, the opening 0 f Book Week, the library staff    and the advisory board invited a nunber of citizens in to a"" Book Week Tea"" at    which time the organization of a "" Friends of the Library"" group was duscussed. The    idea was accepted with much enthusiasm and as a result a permanent organization    known as "" The Friends of the Library"" of the Horton Branch Library was perfected    \ with office~ s elected for the year.    During 1947- 48, the group lIi. et several time s and sponsored two pro jects • ( 1) A    Christmas party where the theme "" What the library has to offer to the community""    was presented in a unique way.

There was an increase    in the demand for technical books, which has undoubtedly    been stimulated since Western Electric began operating in    Winston- Salem. The Library fails in not being able to    buy some of the expensive technical reference books and    in not being able to buy duplicate copies of other books.    The demand for readers and primers for children contin­ued    to be heavy throughout the year, from both teachers    and parents. The shortage was somewhat relieved during    the summer as compared to previous years, however, by    the fact that many of the school libraries remained open    during the vacation months.    The circulation of reading materials for home reading    and study is only one function of the library. Equally    as important are the activities that take place in the ref­erence    or fact- finding department. During the year, 13,311    reference transactions were made. Some of these were    transactions that could be made in only a few minutes.    while others took several hours, depending upon the amount    of material requested and the difficulty in locating it.    Many times other libraries or state and national govern­ment    departments had to be called upon to supply infor­mation    and data that could not be found in our library.    During the year the library staff has made a special effort    toward increasing the reference resources of the library    by expanding the collection of pamphlets, clippings,    pictures, maps and atlases and other resource materials    that could be obtained.

Thirty- nine per cent of the total book stock at the Main    Library is made up of fiction books and 61 per cent of    non- fiction. The book collection at the Horton Branch    totals 9~ 544 volumes, of which 47 per cent are children's    books and 53 per cent are adult books. Fiction books make    up 46 per cent of the total collection at the branch, while    54 per cent are non- fiction or informational books. Of    the total number of books that were added to the book    collections of both libraries during the year, 52 per cent    were informational books. With a total book stock of    47,940 volumes in the Library and all of its agencies, and    with a county population of 145,076, the library now has    approximately one- third of one book for each resident of    the county. The minimum standard that has been recom­mended    by the American Library Association for libraries    serving areas with populations of more than 100,000 is    one and one- half books per capita. To meet this standard    our library would need to increase its book stock by ap­proximately    170,000 volumes. Overcrowded building fa­cilities    and inadequate book stock will continue to be major    problems, however, until a new building is available. The    only way that the present building is able to accommodate    the volumes that we have now is by careful and constant    weeding out of less- used and out- of- date books by members    of the staff to make room on the shelves for more valuable    and more recent publications. The book collections of    larger public libraries and the college and university    libraries in the State are called upon constantly to supply,    as inter- library loans, volumes that are not in our collec­tion.    Even with a new library building there will continue    to be inter- library borrowing, but with a more adequate    book stock, it will be limited to books of a more specialized    and technical nature.

This will be the largest    amount that has been spent for books for our library dur­ing    any year of its history. No doubt this will result in    increased use of the library, as will be evidenced by a    larger membership and a greater book circulation during    the fiscal year 1950- 51.    MEMBERS    At the Main Library 4,369 people registered during    the year to become library members, making a total mem­bership    of 13,988, of which 75 per cent are adults and    25 per cent are children under 14 years of age. At the    Horton Branch, 1,216 new members registered during the    year, making a total membership there of 4,216. Of this    number, 63 per cent are adults and 37 per cent are chil­dren.    Through the local newspapers and radio stations    there has been a continuous effort made throughout the    year to increase the library's membership by announcing    the new books as they were received and by publishing    reports of the library's various activities. However, the    percentage of the total population that makes use of the    library's facilities will continue to be below standard un~ il    there are branch libraries in all sections of the city and    county and until the bookmobile service is given on a full­time    basis instead of part- time. With only one bookmobile,    which is shared by the Main Library and the Horton    Branch, it is impossible to visit the various bookmobile ·    stops and deposit stations throughout the county oftener    than once a month. The service would be greatly improved    if each of these places could be visited at least every two    weeks. This, of course, would necessitate having another    bookmobile, but in a county the size of ours and with a    population the size of this, there really should be two    bOQkmobiles, one for the white library and one for the    colored.

The Survey Research Center of the University of    l\ fichigan recently conducted a National Public Library    Inquiry and found that in all the localities they studied    it was true in every case that the closer people lived to a    public library, the more they used it. Seventy- six of the    respondents to a questionnaire sent out by this group    indicated that they used a particular branch library be­cause    it was close to their home, and another 5 per cent    because it was close to their place of work. They found    also that in cities the major part of the library registrants    and users live within a relatively few blocks of the library    building - about half of them within four to eight blocks.    Never in the history of the world was there a time    when the people needed to be more informed about what    is going on around them than at the present time. Since    the library is the greatest agency of enlightenment for    adults, it is important that it be stocked with up- to- date    books on subjects that will help people in solving the    problems of their everyday lives, and that its services be    extended until they are easily accessible to the entire    population.    THE STAFF    In November the City included the Library staff in    its classification and pay plan, which meant an increased    budget and better salaries for all staff members. This    has made it easier to fill positions as they have become    vacant, and was appreciated by all the staff members.    In December Miss Margaret Moran, the Reference    Librarian, married and went to live in Seattle, Washing­ton.    Miss Dorothy Long acted as Reference Librarian    until July, when she was granted a scholarship to do    further study in the Library School at Columbia Univer-    9",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1234,1234,1235.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1235.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Miss Minnie M'orris Huggins, a graduate of the    Library School at the University of North Carolina, is    now Reference Librarian. Before joining our staff, Miss    Huggins had ga, ined her experience in the Olivia Rainey    Library in Raleigh and in the Washington, D. C., Public    Library. In February Miss Frances Anne Beale, the    Children's Librarian, resigned to take a position in the    children's department of the Richmond, Virginia, Public    Library, which is near her home. Miss Katherine Reid.    who had been a primary teacher for several years in the    Forsyth County Schools, was appointed to fill this position.    Miss Reid had · assisted with the work in the Children's    Department during two summers previously, and the    Library was especially fortunate in having her accept the    position on a permanent basis.    In September · M'rs. R. Graham Williams joined the    staff as cataloger. This position had been filled by part­time    workers over a period of several months. Mrs.    Williams came to the library from the Braswell Memorial    Library in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, where she had    been since 1946. She was graduated from the University    of North Carolina Library School in 1945 and spent a    year as Officers' Librarian at Cherry Point before going    to Rocky Mount.    Mr. Bennie L. Moore, a 1949 graduate of the School    of Library Service of the North Carolina College at Dur­ham,    joined the staff of the Horton Branch at the begin­ning    of the fiscal year as a general assistant in charge of    the bookmobile work at the branch.

The    high cost of printing and the length of time that it took    to type these notices has made it impractical to send them    out heretofore. New sectional card catalog cabinets were    bought, and since these have trays for holding the catalog    drawers, it is an added service for the patrons and makes    for less confusion around the charging desk. At the    Horton Branch a new book truck was bought to make it    easier for the staff to carry collections of books from one    place to another in the library. A new section was also    added to the card catalog at the branch.    GIFTS    During the year several subscriptions to magazines,    as well as a number of books were donated to ' the library.    Outstanding among the gifts was one from Mr. Lucien    Wulsin, President of the Baldwin Company in Cincinnati,    Ohio. Mr. Wulsin gave to the library twenty- five volumes    of "" The Geographical Review,"" the official organ of the    American Geographical Society of New York. Many    people brought and sent flowers to the library during the    year, for which the staff was indeed grateful. The Horton    Branch sponsored a Carver Essay Contest during the year    and received donations for the awards that were made to    the winners. The Negro Cllamber of Commerce donated    $ 15.00, the Safe Bus and Camel City Cab Company do­nated    $ 10.00, and Mr. D. W. Andrews donated $ 5.00.    Also the Drama Group of The Friends of the Library    Organization at the branch library collected $ 42.00 in    proceeds from a play given during the year, and this    amount is to be used for the purchase of new equipment    for the branch library.    11",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1236,1236,1237.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1237.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been found in libraries throughout the country that    book circulation increases during times of business depres­sions    and decreases as economic conditions improve. An­other    depression would probably send the circulation of    our library above the 1931 figure, and it would more nearly    approach the minimum standard of 7 books per capita    than it did then.

The present Library facilities are woefully inadequate. There is such a shortage of space that    as new books come in, old ones have to be removed to make room. There is no place for the Librar­ians    to process the books.    Perhaps the worst feature of the present Library is the location on the top floor of the Agri­cultural    Building, reached by a long flight of very steep steps. Many older people who would like    to use the Library are unable to do so because of the steps.    Furthermore, there is a serious parking problem at the present location - for the Library    staff, the Bookmobiles, and for people borrowing books.    Why Doesn't The County Build A New Library?    According to law, the County Commissioners cannot use tax money for building purposes un­less    such money is derived from a tax levy for a specific bUilding program. Regular tax funds can    be used only for the running expense of the Library. So the only money the County can give to­ward    a building program is that which has been derived from other than tax sources.    How Much Will A New Library Cost?    The Library Board working with the County Commissioners and architects have estima~ the    cost of an adequate Library at $ 125,000.00. Of this amount, $ 100,000.00 has already been promised    by the County, the manufacturers of Caldwell County, and the Lenoir Service League. Also, a val­uable    building site on the northwest comer of East College Avenue and Norwood Street has been    donated.    There remains only $ 25,000.00 to be raised by the individuals of Caldwell County.    How Does The Library Serve The People Of Caldwell County?    The MAIN LIBRARY provides everything from pre- school age. picture l100ks through adult    reading of every type. There is also available:    Books for special interests- gardening, interior decoration, religion, travel, and hundreds    of other SUbjects    ij. eference books for students    Magazines, new and old, completely indexed for years back    Sound movies and sound projectors    Records and record players    The BOOKMOBILES serve every school and every community in the County. The libraries at    the school are kept well stocked by the Bookmobiles, and many stops are made at private homes to    leave books for an entire neighborhood.

KI    lois lenski ( Mrs. Arthur S. Covey), born in Springfield,    Obio, is the daughter of a Lutheran minister, and was    graduated from Chio State University, College of Education.    She studied art at the Art Students League in New York, and    at the Westminister School of Art in London.    The ROUNLABOUT AMERICA story books have a special appeal    for children because they are filled with little incidents    and real Ufe drama that make up a child's day. Miss Lenski's    knowledge of the ways of children in different parts of our    country comes from a close association with them. Before be­ginning    a story, she goes to the city or area about which    she writes, visits with families, makes notes and sketches    of the children at work and at play.    In 1946 Miss Lenski won the Newbery Medal for STRAWBERRY    GIRL, one of her popular series of American Regional Books    for grades 5 to 7. She was also given the Child Study Assoc­iation    Award in 1948 for JUDY'S JOURNEY.

I    Since 1924 Mrs. Martha Sebastian has    served as Librarian continuously and under    her guidance and leadership the library has    become one of the strongest Negro libraries    in the South and today, it is serving not    only Greensboro proper but the whole of    Guilford County with a collection of over    13,000 of the best and most up- to- date vol­umes    to be found in . any library.    The continuous growth of the Library    has been maintained by the faithful ~ ervice    rendered by the Board. Through their ef­forts    the appropriation has b~ en increased    from time to time, thus making it possible    to improve the service.    . Many citizens, both white and colored    have made note- worthy contributions to the    library. The late Mrs. E.

Let's Build One !    Access to a good public library is vital    to all citizens. A well- organized, cen­trally    located public library is an open    door to knowledge and an open invi­tation    to wisdom and understanding.    The Greensboro Public Library is in    a building containing 10,124 square feet.    Architects and library consultants ad­vise    a minimum of 75,000 square feet    for the central library of Guilford    County.    Shelves are so crowded that books    must be piled on top of others and    valuable books are often damaged.    A reading room containing more seat­ing    space is needed.    Young adults deserve a reading room    of their own. Many readers of this    age leave the library for more attractive    surroundings.    The children's room is crowded and    there is no place for a story hour.    The collection of materials on O.    Henry, Greensboro, Guilford County and    North Carolina should be housed in an    ample fireproof room.    Collections on business and insurance,    gardening, music and art have grown    in size and use until a large alcove    is. needed for each collection.    There is need for space to house a    film collection.    More rooms are needed for small civic    groups and the growing activities of    the adult services department.    Coin- operated typewriters for public    use have been often requested, but there    is no space.    Work and office space is needed.    Elevators and book lifts are a neces­sity.    The library staff spends many    hours carrying books and heavy bound    periodicals up and down the steps.    A receiving and shipping room is a    necessity.    An attached garage is needed so book­mobiles    can be loaded and unloaded    under shelter.    Much of the building is inadequately    lighted and air conditioning is needed    for the public comfort. Controlled hu­midity    will lengthen the life of a book.    These are just several of the many    reasons why Greensboro must have a    new public library - NOW. The time    has come when Greensboro and Guilford    County citizens should no longer need    to offer shamefaced apologies as to why    they value public library service so much    less than neighboring cities in North    Carolina.",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1291,1291,1292.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1292.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tract recommended by the com­mittee    contains 26,931 square feet. Li­brary    officials have requested a mini­mum    of 20,000 square feet.    A public library will be most valuable    and useful to its patrons if located    within reach of the greatest number    of people.    The vital need in erecting a library    is placing the building where the shop­ping    crowd is thickest. Greensboro li­brarians    agree with this principle, par­ticularly    since there is considerable use    of library resources by business and    professional people during lunch hours.    A library erected on the proposed    site would be convenient to pedestrian    and motor traffic. Branch libraries will    be situated in other areas of the city    and county.    Working closely with city and county    officials, librarians and city planners    have been two organizations whose    members recognized the immediate need    for better library facilities in Greens­boro.    Members of the Friends of the Li­brary    and the Altrusa Club have ac­tively    supported the campaign for a    new public library to be located in down­town    Greensboro. Many other civic and    community clubs are strongly promoting    this project.    Public officials and prominent · civic    and community leaders are objectively    supporting the downtown site. Here are    comments:    "" There is a definite need for a new    . public library to serve Greensboro and    Guilford County. The city council of    GTeensboro, in cooperation with the    library board of trustees, has. chosen    a downtown site which I feel will be    ideal for the location of the new build­ing:'    Mayor George Roach.    "" A new downtown public library is    Greensboro's number one need. Now    that the city council, with the help of    Guilford County Commissioners, has    chosen a central location, library trus­tees    invite citizens everywhere to join    in the building campaign."" William D.    Snider, chairman of the library board    Q: f managers.    "" After careful study, the board of    directors of the Greensboro Chamber    of Commerce found the present library    facilities totally inadequate. The board    recommended to the city council that    a new library facility be provided in    the downtown area. A completely new,    modern library plant, sufficiently large    to meet Greensboro's needs for the next    30 to 50 years, will alleviate the urgent    need."" William B.

U~ j FlU};?,' DJ    They never bother you when you- r,. t' 18y, and they never sulk when you wmt them.    Different kinds of books make differe:"" i' [{ i nds of friends; you can find the kind 01    friend you want if you get hold of th0 right kirill of book. Your Bookmobile will    bring you many different friends:    1. TO HELP YOU ~ nTH A JOB YOU WANT TQ ~ O WELL.    Do you want to raise bees? or rufinisl1 an old table? or repair your radj. o,    or the farm tractor? or cook better meals? You can eet books to help you with any    of these jobs from your Boo~ nobile.    2. TO HIt P Y6tl UJDBRSTAND ', v'HAT IS GOING ON IN POLITICS.    Does the news you hear on the radio worr, y you? There are books that will help    you understand the things that happen1 here at home and in all the different coun­tries    of the world. Vihen you understand what is happening1 you can often figure out    something to do about it. Books can help you be ~ better citizen of your own com­munitY1    of the whole country1 and of the world.    3. TO HELP YOU ENJOY THE THINGS AROUND YOU EVERY DAY.    Do you know the names of the different trees that grow in your woods? Can you    tell which flowers come out first in the spring, or which birds stay through the Wi"" l­ter?    Do you knoVT where the baby chipmunks live? 1' h\ 3se and a thousand things thai~    go on around you every day are explained in books.    4. TO HELP YOU JEARN THINGS YOU DIDN'T GET IN SCHOOL.    Reading is a fine way tili catch up on things you didn't have time to learn dur­ing    school. Books can help you - books about history and the interesting people of    the past, about strange and far- away places1 about science and better ways of living.    5. TO HELP YOU WAKE YOUR CLUB PROGRAM, OR YOUR PART A SUCCESS.    Does your club want to learn something about ~ outh america? Would your Sunday    School Class enj oy a book about the Bible? Or your 4- H Club membe: rs want help in    planning a camping'trip, or a hobby show? Ask the Bookmobile. .    6. TO MAKE YOUR FAMILY'S LIVING MORE FUN.    "" Give children a few good books and you're putting them on the double- track    line to happiness."" Many f3Jllilie s like to read books aloud so they all c an enjoy    them at the same time. Books are fine things to t:: tlk about whUe you do the dishes,    or clean up the barn1 or just to think about while youlre doing a job by yourself.    7. TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE YOU LIm WITH.    Sometimes it's hard to tell what people are really thinking and why they act    the way they do. A good story tells you what the people in it are thinking, so    that you can understand flesh- and blood people better for knowing the story people.    Besides1 there are books about growing children, that may help you understand your    family better.    8. TO GIVE YOU A VACATION RIGHT AT HOME.    Of course you get tired of the same place and the same work sometimes. A good    book to read when your day's work is over can carry your mind as far away a~ the    longest vacation. And you come back from that book- journey with something new to    think about while you do your next dayt s work.    9. TO KEEP YOUR HEARTS FROM BEING LONELY.    The friend of the heart is one who makes clear for us the things vre have only    partly understood for ourselves. All of us need such friends, and there are books    that can give us much of that kind of understanding. When we share that kind of a    book with the person who is dearest, both book and person grow dearer and more com­forting.

J . Lassiter, Sr.    The Johnston County Library has been In existence since Augusg 15, 1941 when the    county commissioners met and appropriated $ 3,000 for library service and approved a    library board of six members in compliance with the state library law.    The foundation for the establishment of county library service had been laid by    the Woman's Clubs of Smithfield, Clayton, Benson, Selma and Eenly when through their    efforts public library service was established in each of these towns. Through the    co- operation of these clubs, the State Library Commission and the VP A, a bookmobile    was brought to Johnston County to distribute books to the rural areas for six weeks    in 1938, and again for two months in 1940. The movement for county- wide service was    aided also by the county home demonstration agent who in 1938 began taking books    borrowed from the State Library Commission to her club meetings. A special VP A    worker was secured to have charge of this service. Interest in reading was stimulated    by the offering of an award of merit to each club woman who read ten books during the    year, four of which were to be non- fiction. This was the forerunner of the reading    certificate r&gt; lan now in use in the State Federation of Home Demonstration Clubs.    With a taste of what library service could mean, promoters of county- wide ser­vice    told their story to the county commissioners and secured the f i r s t appropriation.    This enabled participation in State Aid, which was f i r s t voted by the North Carolina    legislature in 1941. The f i r s t year Johnston received $ 1,298,35 which together with    the $ 3,000 county appropriation made possible the employment of a trained librarian,    the purchase of a bookmobile and the purchase of a few books.    At the same time the five town libraries already operating were to continue ef­forts    to extend services as well as to co- operate in the county- wide system which    established bookmobile stops throughout the county and encouraged new town libraries.    During the very firstt year of State Aid in Johnston County, the policy of building    county- wide library service through the financial support of state, county and local",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1304,1304,1305.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1305.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BOOKMOBILE OPERATIONS    On June 30, 1942, the bookmobile began operation. It has traveled 47,931 miles    and now covers the county every two weeks making 98 stops a t f i l l i n g stations, homes,    community houses, libraries, schools, institutions, beauty shops, grist mills and    manufacturing companies. Benders have the privilege of selecting books from the    collection on hand, as well as of requesting certain books to be brought on the re­turn    trip. 2,589 such requests have been f i l l ed since 1944 when a record was started.    Recent requests have been for information and materials on the United Nations, the    State Health Program, North Carolina music, drama, history, parks and books on family    l i f e , oil painting, dry cleaning, mixing dyes, radio, engineering, and novels with    early American and also World War I background. There are many, of course, for the    best seller l i s t , Forever Amber. The Egg and I. Toil of the Brave and the like.

In summer, the bookmobile offers to the rural children the story hour and vaca­tion    reading club which the branch libraries give the town children. A trained libra­rian    is employed for two months in the summer for this work.    Occasionally the librarian takes the bookmobile to a home demonstration club    and talks about good reading. Just recently she talked on books and book reports to    the County Council of Home Demonstration work with over 100 women from every part of    the county in attendance, and at the conclusion the bookmobile librarian gave out    book collections from the bookmobile to club education chairmen for circulation in    their respective clubs.    In 1945 a rural reading club for adults was sponsored by the bookmobile libra-    *    rian. Women over the county read special books covering counttres where their sons    and other relative were stationed during the war. In the spring the women got to­gether    one afternoon and discussed the books, and examined gifts and maps.    A library column gX% 8X3ffiHHgI8IJTX written by a library staff member appeared    weekly in the Smithfield Herald from September 1941 until April 30, 1946.    The County Library has entered a library float in the annual Parmer's Day parade    far the past four years as a publicity stunt. It won second prize in 1944.    The librarian and assistant librarian have answered numerous calls during the    past five years to speak to county groups, Rotary and Kiwanis clubs, Women's Clubs,    i    B P W clubs, War Mothers, PTAfS, American Legion, Girls. Scouts and book clubs. They    have aided in the preparation of book club studies.    There being no trained person employed by the schools in the county, the county    librarian has spent several days! in five or six schools of the county directing l i b ­rary    organization. Assistance in the classification and selection of books has been    requested by several schools.

To begin with, you had to sell the idea first to those who held    the purse strings, and then to the people in general. This was not easy, but    with a Librarian ( Virginia Williamson) so inspired and so efficient, also a    Library Board with a Chairman such as Mrs. T. J. Lassiter, a fire of enthusiasm    soon spread that could not be quenched. We met with every conceivable group    that had the betterment of their respective t~ NnS and communities at heart. The    County Commissioners, Town Commissioners, Civic Clubs and Library Boards all listen­ed    patiently and encouragingly.    At one dinner meeting with the County Commissioners, Governor J. Melville Broughton,    and Miss Marjorie Beal, head of the State Library Cornmission, were present to reView    the County Library plan presented by Miss Williamson. Speeches by both the Governor    and Miss Beal in support were eloquently presented. In response, Mr. Robert Holding,    Chairman of the County Commissioners, began by enumerating the many obligations    and debts the County was already laboring under. Suddenly Miss Williamson in­terrupted    and said,  Mr. Holding, do you mean to tell us that the County must wait    until it is out of debt before we may expect an appropriation?"" "" No, Miss Virginia,""    he replied, "" By no means did I intend to imply that. I only wanted all of you to    understand the c onditions • Itm with you all the way. II May I say now he was,    always urging for greater appropriations as the Library proved itself.    l- 1e met with Negro leaders in all towns fOl"" ming library committees. They too,    proved very effective and helpfUl in those early years. They raised money for    the book fUnd and secured responsible people to take care of collections of books.    The Home Demonstration leaders and teachers went before the County Commissioners    pleasing the cause and urging for more appropriations. They also wrote letters,    and sent telegrams to our legislators, both state and national, in support of the    library movement which was catching fire across the nation. It really seemed that    a new dimension of culture was being born~ Books and libraries were no longer    left to big cities and those of wealth. The Woman's Clubs had started the move­ment    in all the small towns during the W. p. A. days. These ladies had cleaned    out their attics and book shelves to supply a collection for their respective    libraries while the W. P. A. paid the worker to Keep the library. Such libraries    as these were the foundation stones uppnnwhich the Johnston County Library was    built. The State Library Commission sent us three thousand books and others at    intervals as they could afford.    To correlate the town libraries under one over a~ l system was one of the first steps    in the development, so the Selma Library Board invited all the Library Boarss in    the County to a dinner. Our principal speaker at that time was Miss Gladys    Johnson of the North Carolina State Library Commission. At this meeting it was    decided to have an Annual Trustee's Dinner under the direction of the County Libpa­rian.    ,. Other towns were happy to take their respective turn as hostess. This    proved to be worthwhile, gathering all trustees and library friends together for    an informative and literary feast; as we were able to get such speakers as Richard    Walser, Josephenia Neggli, Jonathan Daniels, Miss Elizabeth House, now Mrs. Eliza­beth    Hughey, State Librarian, and others.    In the year 1) 49, Miss T illiamson went to Aireborough Urban District Libraries in    Yorkshire, England as exchange librarian and ¥ QSS Margaret Scoffield came to    Johnston County. This proved to be a memorable year lor us at least.

Elizabeth Sanders, my capable and efficient assistant on the Bookmobile, and I    talked about asking the farmers for bundles of tobacco. We also talked to our    bookmobile patrons through the county. They were enthusiastic about it and felt    we could surely raise the required amount in this manner. After getting the con­sent    of Mrs. T. J. Lassister, Chairman of the Johnston County Library Board and    our Librarian, Miss Margaret Shoffield we set out to this end. The response was    magnificent. Each day we brought in our load to tobacco, and stacked it in one    room of the Library until sale day. Mr. Lawrence Wallace sold it in his warehouse    with no cost to us. '\&lt;' lhen the last sale was made we had $ 577.00. That hurdle had    been made and we had made new friends by the effort.    Selling the bookmobile to the rural people was hot so easy in those first years.    As I think back over our twenty- three years, I see our people in two catagories.    First there were those who took the negative approach. Of this group, we found    some who were suspicious because we said it was free. As we drove up to a filling    station, store and dwelling combined, the very young wife came bounding out want­ing    some love stories; while the very young husband said. "" Put them books down.""    But she said, "" They don't cost nothing, I've been reading about the bookmobile    in the Harold."" "" Put' em down."" he shouted, "" there's a ketch there somewhere.    You don't get anything for nothing."" He still sat on the steps as we explained    he was paying for them when he paid his taxes.    There were those who were ignorant of the value of supplementary reading the year    around, especially for the children. There was the farmer that would not let his    girls leave their work at a tobacco barn saying, "" They've been at school nine    months and that ought bo be enough of books. Now they've got to work."" At    another country store several farmers awaited our arrival saying, "" I just wanted    to see what the bookmobile ' Ivas like;"" but pleasantly reminded us that this was    the time the kids had to work and not read. I'm happy to recall this type was    not in the majority. It takes a great deal of tact to remain cool, collected and    calm while agreeing with them; but pointing out · that surely sometime after supper    they might have a little time to read one book, and maybe he would like one for    himself. We believe this type has completely disappeared from our runal scene.    A very few were indifferent to the whole idea. While seeking contributions for    the memorial book fund, we cal~ on one of our most prominent men, who was very    intelligent and wealthy. We explained the whole set- up for him in detail. He    dismissed us with this: "" Thank you ladies for coming, but I'm not interested.""    In the second catagory we found eager seekers for all types of books, informative    books, pleasure reading and self improvement books were eagerly sought for. Many    times we heard someone say, "" This is the nicest thing the county has ever done for    us."" How well I remember the dear old farmer as he came plodding across the    ploughed field to the W. P. A. Bookmobile. All smiles he said, "" ould it be possible,    that you might have some of the old philosophers such as Socrates, Plato and others?    I've always wanted to read them, but have never had the opportunity."" Needless to    say we did not, but he took the best thfungs we had. v- lhen our County Bookmobile,    came into being, Mr. Pharoah Kornegay became one of our best readers until his    death a few years ago.

How we have wished you could come to our house."" Yes, you guessed it, Misses    Cora and Ida Edgerton kept a collection for the community as long as they lived.    These two experiences could be repeated many times over and over as we covered the    County from the borders of Wayne, Sampson, Harnett to Wake and Nash Counties.    If you've never been a bookmobile librarian you have missed a lot. You learn all    about the people, their sorrOT. vs and joys, deaths and births. You eat with them,    come horne with vegetables, and at hog- killing time some of the freah meats, sausage    and the like; and it's nice to hear them say we just live from one bookmobile day    to the next. It's great to have had a part in bringing the joy of books to the    older folk.    The children with all of their eagerness and happiness; the young people with    their hopes and aspirations and quest for books; you become a part of their lives.    You no longer live in the town where you sleep and eat, but when asked I~ ere you    live'-' you are happy to say IIJohnston County. II    During the early years, we conducted a reading program in the summer from the    bookmobile and all of the Branch libraries; and provided a story teller foo the    libraries. At one store in the northern part of the County, they were holding    court of some kind, vaccinations for the children; and our story- teller waw there    telling stories to the many children. When we drove up, all the kids left every­thing    and flocked to the bookmobile. II OW,"" sez I, "" Who rates here?""    During the war years we had a very active reading program with the wives and sweet­hearts    of the men in every theatre of the war. They wanted to learn about the    Countries in which their loved ones were stationed. As we recall there were over    fifty members of this group. We gathered material of all kinds - books, maps and    magazine articles for each respective person. We remember the girl who asked for    a certain magazine saying, "" J.': ly boy friend can not tell me where he is but to be    sure to get this magazine."" We did get it and it carried the first instail. iLment    of the "" Gauda1cana1 Diary."" To complete thisstory, after the war they were    married and continued to be our readers. Records were kept on the hookmobile of    each reader. In one community meeting of these ladies they arranged to bring to­gether    all the momentos sent them from these far- away places. We placed a map of    the world on the wall, and by placing thumb tacks on every country represented by    all of Johnston County readers; it presented a very revealing picture. This waS    written up by a representative of the Wilson Library Bulletin in November 1946.    To be sure no one waS left out we secured a map of the county, showing the roads,    schools, Churches and all other buildings. On this we used colored pins to de­signate    all of our stops. In this way we were able to see which part of the County    was not covered. At one farm horne near the Wake County line we found a young    University of North Carolina student waiting and eagerly saying, "" I thought you    would never come. I wrote you about two months ago, asking for the service but    I had decided we lived too far from Smithfield."" We called this our ¥ Jissionary    work on the fringe and in the interior. By this revealing may, we were able to    cover every part of the county.    We had many visiting librarians from foreign countries, Brazil, Puerto Rico, India,    and Sweden. They went out on the Bookmobile, anxious to see how this was done.

The librarian from Calcutta, India, was so impressed with our farms and at one of    our stops they were in the midst of tobacco setting.

To begin With, the greatest demand for improved library service    was created by cha. nges in educational methods. Prior to 1900, all    schools and most colleges used the textbook method of teaching exclusively.    NU01CTOUZ; inventions and rapid advances in all fields of knowlodge which    beean to OCCt~ about 1900 soon made n~ ny textbooks obsolete.    Since two or three years are required to v~ ite, publish and distri­butetextbooks,    educators had to find some other means for grineing    teaching materials into line with current knov; loogc.

Pupils in Junior    and Senior High Schools and most elementary schools have had lessons in tr~    use of library facilities, which lessons they put into practice at the Public    L~ brary and its branches.    YounG Adults    4    HOwever, the chief responsibility placed on pUblic librar1es in recent    years by this new method of teaching is not from school children. It comes    from those who have completed formal education which included training in    library techniques. Trained in the use of library materialS. and encouraged    to progress in their chosen fields through continuous studY,' thousands have    turned immediately from school libraries to pUblic libraries.    The South was somewhat slow in providing school libraries. In Charlotte    they first began to operate effectively about the time Central High School    was opened in 1923 and the present Jwiior High Sc&gt; ools ~ stablished. Othervlise,    the necessity for prOViding better pUblic. library service would have arisen.    long ago.    As matters now stand, this process has gone on in Mecklenburg COU:: lty for    many years•. I':; has now produced a volu, me of adult library patrons who tax    the building, resources and personnel of the present plant far beyond the    point where fu~ ything like satisfactory service can be given. This would have    been true had the enrollment of school eligibles remained at its 1890 level.    I~ stead the enrollment of children in the six to nineteen year old group is    two thirds higher than it v~ s, largely because of compulsory eguc~ tion legis­lation.    Because the schools are continually producing patrons, the inadequacy'    of the present library'building would exist had the population remained static.    Instead, the building which was expected to acconwodate 18,091 citizens of    Cilarlotte in 1900, must now be strained to serve 151,826 citizens of Meck­lenburg    COt~ 1ty.    ~ lese developments explain why chief enthusiasm for library service comes    from younger men' and women rather'than those whose formal education lacked    library training. ~ e thousands of school and college graduates who now    depend on the public library for reference material offer a striking contrast    to the small group which patronized the Lihrary in 1903, mostly for books    by Louisa M. Alcott, Mark ~'~ in and other authors of recreational reading    matter.    So much for the increased number of patrons with · their more diverse and    serious requirements who have been thrust upon ~ ublic libraries by changed    educational processes. l/ hat other' trends have literally driven people into    public libraries?

The former custom was to    house all magazines in one room, reference books in another and the general,'    circulating book stock ina conunon bookstack. The present and far more    efficient practice for both the staff and the user is to assemble all material    related to. a subject in a department under a specially trained ' member of the    staff"" Thus, modern libraries have many librall'ies'within the library as    "" Religio~ and Philosophy"", "" Business, and Economicsl!, "" Technology and Agri­culture"".    "" Fine Art~:"" and a number' of others. Obviously the present building    is not large enough, nor can it be re- designed to meet these reqUirements.    In 1903 it was customary for subscribers to retain files of their favorite    magazinos. Homes were spacious. There was plenty of storage space and fe\' ler    distractions from reading the magazines from time to time. Conditions changed    with increasing speed until storage space all but vanished trom most homes as    did much of the time for reading, not to mention re- reading. A natural result    of these changes was that the pUblic very sensibly began discarding magazines    and, whcn needed, to depend on pUblic libraries. What amazes older patrons most    is that their favorite magazinos are not only caretully and conveniently pre­served    but th4t they are accurately indexed - in consolidated indexes. By using    these indexes, long hours of tedious sQarching for'someelusive article is    reduced to a matter of minutes in a modern library.

Many of these requests come from employoes, wives    and children of ousincss and professional men who disclaim ever having re­motely    benefited by library service.    Donald R. Burgess of the Department of Commerco in a recent address made    this significant statement:    "" The premium on being well informed in business is becoming greater    all th~ time ascompctition becomes keener. One thousand new busi­nesses    opened. their doors every day in the year before the"" war, and    one ~ thousand others failed overy day.

Some may    want to know more in detail why standards    of library service are so much higher than    formerly.    The Charlotte Planning Board in a re­port    to the City Council recommending the    improved library service program for Char­lotte    and Mecklenburg County made this    significant statement at the beginning of    their Report:    "" Modern library service bears slight    resemblance to the type of service con­sidered    satisfactory when the present    Charlotte library building was completed    soon after the beginning of the Twentieth    Century.""    All of the changes in library service have    b(; en made in response to demands thrust    upon libraries by various groups composing    the citizenship of the city and county.    To begin with, the greatest demand for    improved library service was created by    changes in educational methods.

USE OF LIBRARIES TAUGHT    Since two or three years are required    tn write, publish and distribute textbooks,    educators had to find some other means for    bringing teaching materials into line with    current knowledge. They began to supple­ment    textbooks with newspapers, maga­zines,    pamphlets and newer readable books.    Thus, real school libraries came into exist­ence.    Instruction in the use of libraries    became a part of the school curriculum.    Education through thinking replaced edu­cation    by rote. Pupils began to be taught    \ vhere and how to find information and    knowledge, not alone for their studies,    but. as a lifelong process to be used as    needs arise.    ' J; he plan of using. library materials to    supplement textbooks soon became known    as the "" laboratory methorl"" of teaching.    This method is now used everywhere. In    many places the library is considered the    "" heart"" of all school curricula activities.    The influence of this new method of    tf~ aching soon began to be felt in public    libraries.

SERVICE INSTITUTION TODAY    From a "" Storehouse for Books"" in 1903,    the public library has been forced to be­come    a dynamic service institution. Routine    practice not only requires alertness in as­s(    1mbling all material for which any citizen    of . the community may find need, but in­itiative    in getting the right material in the    hands of the right person at the right time.    Any citizen may record his or her interests    at the Library and · be assured of being    nctified when new material on the subject    becomes available.    In this respect few people realize the ex­tent    of library patronage even with the    present limited resources. Right now an    average of 1,056 books are borrowed daily,    every da. y in the year including all Sun­days    and. holidays. Nearly a quarter of a    inillion people annually view educational    motion pictures provided by the Library.    Perio( lical a, nd newspaper room readers    total more than 100,000 each year. In the    year ending June 30, 1945, 22,937 research    and reference questions were answered.    During the same period ' 253 meetings were    held in the Library's one dismal meeting    room. To meet these requirements, the    Central Library is kept open from 9 a. m.    to 9 p. m. daily and on Sunday afternoons.    13",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1338,1338,1339.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1339.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIBRARIANSHIP A PROFESSION    What have libraries and · librarians done    t'J meet the responsibilities thrust upon    them by these various groups and trends?    Their achievements speak for themselves.    From a leisurely, clerical occupation some    50 to 60 years ago, librarianship has grown    into an honored profession. There are 33    professional library schools in this Country    and Canada. Entrance requirements are    as high as for other professions as law,    medicine, engineering and theology.    Like the other professions, the field of    librarianship is so broad that most librari­ans,    aside from those in very small institu­tions,    specialize in SOl1le one type of library    work. Each requires a special course of    study with appropriate experience as in­ternship.    •    In addition to training, the librarian    nHlst be alert for new sources of informa­tion    and must keep abreast of the latest    news developments.

School training in the use of library    resources has produced a volume of young    adult patrons far larger than present li­brary    facilities are able to accommodate ad­equately.    3. There has been a vast increase in    materials used for recording and transmit­ting    knowledge, all of which are necessary    to rnodern library service.    4. Rapid and complete library service    now requires that all related materials be    brought into departments- an arrangenlent    not possible under existing conditions.    5. The Public Library has become a    nluch used community Information and Ed­ucational    Center.    6. Inter- library loan systems have been    developed whereby each patron ha, s access    tv world- wide library materials- a develop­ment    which requires additional personnel    and space.    15",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1340,1340,1341.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1341.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The growing use of the Children's    Department demands larger space and per­sonnel.    . 8. More space and personnel must be    provided for expanding the system of white    and negro branches throughout the city    and county - so that no citizen. will be    denied the privilege of convenient, free li­brary    service.    9. Returning veterans, having had ac­cess    to excellent library service, expect the    same high type of service at home.    10. The present library building sub­jects    the most important collection of local    historical data to a constant fire hazard.    These are the ten leading reasons why    the Charlotte Planning Board opened its    recomm~ ndation for better library service    by stating "" Modern library · service bears    slight resemblance to the type of service    considered satisfactory when the present    Charlotte Library building was completed.""

C.    CHARLOTTE LITERARY AND LIBRARY ASSOCIATION    The Public Library in Charlotte had its origin in the    suggestion of two young citizens, Mr. Willis B. Dowd and Mr.    John M. Walker, Jr. These two consulted with General Rufus    Barringer, Mr. J. Lenoir Chambers and Mrs. Bessie Lacy Dewey,    with the result of issuing a call for library organization    in January 1 8 9 1 . On January 16, I 8 9 I a meeting of prominent    citizens was held in the old Law Library on North Church    Street, and a Constitution was adopted for the Charlotte    Literary and Library Association. The General Assembly of    North Carolina passed an Act of Incorporation on February 1 2 ,    1891 and on February 20, I 8 9 I , the Charlotte Literary and    Library Association was completely organized. The Library    thus started was a subscription association, open to any one    who chose to pay fifty cents per month.    In March I 8 9 I , Mrs. Bessie Lacv Dewey was elected Librarian    and served from March 1 9 , I89I until her death on November 8,    1900. Rooms were secured over the book store of Messrs.    Stone and Barringer on South Tryon Street. The Charter or    "" Active"" members contributed a fixed amount to secure these    rooms, furnish them and buy books.    CHARLOTTE PUBLIC SCHOOL LIBRARY    With the idea of increasing the usefulness of the Library,    the Directors of the Library, at a joint meeting with the    School Commissioners, held January 2 9 , 1 9 0 1 , agreed to trans­fer    the Library to the School Commissioners. The Library was    thereafter known as the Charlotte Public School Library, the    books were moved into two rooms in the City Hall which stood    on the Southeast corner of North Tryon and East Fifth Streets,    and Miss Sallie H, Adams was made Librarian. Dr. George W.    Graham, the President of the Literary and Library Association,    continued his interest and was able to secure authority from    the General Assembly for the School Commissioners to appro­priate    money to maintain a free library for all white per­sons    in the City of Charlotte.",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1351,1351,1352.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1352.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mrs. Annie Smith Ross became Librarian    on November 1 1 , 1902 and continued in that position until 1909*    In 1901 Mr. Thomas S. Franklin, a member of the Board of Alder­men    of Charlotte, had approached Mr. Andrew Carnegie about    erecting a library building for Charlotte. Mr. Carnegie agreed    to give $ 20,000. for a Free Library building if the City of    Charlotte would furnish a suitable site and agree to tax itself    and support the Library at a cost of not less than $ 2,500,00    a year. Later in the year Mr. Carnegie increased his gift to    $ 25,000. A charter was granted by the General Assembly on    January 31, 1903. The annual appropriation of $ 2,500. for the    maintenance of the Library was ratified by a vote of the people    on May 6, 1901. The building was planned by the architects,    Wheeler and McMichael. Mr. McMichael gave his personal super­vision    to the erection of the building. The contract for the    construction was given to Lazenby Brothers, Mr. W. J. Lazenby    taking active charge of the work. The building was erected on    North Tryon Street just two and one half blocks from the Square,    the center of the City, and was formally dedicated and opened    to the public on July 2, 1903, with a collection of about 3,000 books. The land on which the building stands was pur­chased    by a City appropriation of $ 10,135. and gifts from citi­zens    amounting to $ 2,325.    The charter granted in January 1903 also provided for a    public library for colored people, and named six negro men to    form a body corporate known as the "" Charlotte Public Library    for Colored People"". In 1905 ( probably June), the Brevard    Street Library for Negroes was opened. This was operated under    a Board of Trustees of prominent Negroes, who in turn were    under the supervision of the Board of Trustees of the Charlotte    Carnegie Public Library. In 1929 when the Library hegan partici­pation    in the Rosenwald Fund, the Brevard Street Library was    brought under the supervision of the Librarian of the Charlotte    Carnegie Public Library, and continues as a Branch of the    present Public Library System, being the main agency for ser­vice    to the Negro population of Charlotte and Mecklenburg    County.    In 1909 Mrs. Ross resigned as Librarian and Miss Mary B.    Palmer was appointed to succeed her. In 1915 Mr. Andrew Carnegie    gave an additional $ 15,000. which was used to add the present    Children's Department and an auditorium. On April 9, 1915, the    Annex, comprising the Children's Department and the Auditorium,    was opened to the public. The architect for the Annex was Mr.    J. M.

In 1919 the Board of Education by agreement with the Li­brary    Board made the city school libraries branches of the    Public Library. Later the county school libraries were also    made branches of the Public Library.    CHARLOTTE PUBLIC LIBRARY    In 1925, though with no official authorization, the Library    began to be called the Charlotte Public Library, and the letter­heads    were so printed.    As an incentive to library development in the South, the    Rosenwald Fund was established by Mr. Julius Rosenwald of    Chicago. Entering into an agreement with the Rosenwald Cor­poration    the Charlotte Public Library accepted in 1929 a con­ditioned    appropriation of $ 80,000. to be distributed over a    period of five years. That year saw the beginning of an exten­sion    of library services throughout Mecklenburg County. By    1931 five branches in the five towns in the county and thirty-seven    stations in Negro schools had been established. The white    school libraries in City and County were already branches of the    Public Library. The Library for Negroes, which, since its begin­ning    in 1905, had been operating separately, was brought under    the jurisdiction of the Charlotte Public Library as one of its    branches. The annual appropriation, including the Rosenwald    Fund, was $ 66,000. for the two years, 1929- 30 and 1930- 31. The    book collection, including school libraries, amounted to 106,603    volumes. There was a - staff of twenty- eight people.    In 1931, owing to the depression, the City and County ap­propriations    which had been a condition of the Rosenwald Fund's    participation were drastically cut, causing the discontinuance    of Rosenwald aid and the Library suffered a decrease in staff    from twenty- eight people to eleven people, and a great decrease    in book- buying and in services.    In 1935, the Library obtained a grant from the City to clean    and improve the building at 310 North Tryon Street. At that time    improved incandescent lights were installed throughout the build­ing,    the outside of the building was cleaned, and the inside was    repainted. The cost was about $ 3,500.    Miss Anne Pierce resigned as Head Librarian on June 30, 1937, and Mr. James E. Gourley was elected Director, coming to    the Charlotte Public Library from the New York Public Library    on September 15, 1937. In 1938, under Mr. Gourley's direction,    the basement, formerly very inadequately lighted, where maga­zines    were stored, was furnished with stacks to take care of a    great many more magazines, and with lights among the stacks to    make the magazines more accessible.

During Mr. Gourley's regime, with a slight increase in ap­propriations    library service was again extended by the establish­ment    of deposit stations in 37 stores and homes throughout the    County. For the months of December 1937 and January 1938, the    Library had the use of the bookmobile belonging to the North    Carolina Library Commission. This made possible the opening of    these stations. After the bookmobile was returned, the service    was continued with the two Library cars. Later, one car was    stolen and wrecked, and the Library purchased a Dodge Panel truck    which was used to serve the stations.    Through the aid of workers supplied by the Works Progress    Administration, the County Town branches were able to increase    their hours of service. The W. P. A. also gave considerable aid    in book- mending, and in typing and other clerical work in the    Catalog and Children's D partments, and in some of the sub-branches    in the City.    Early in the year 1939, with the revision of the City Char­ter,    the Library Charter came under the scrutiny of the City    Attorney, and it was discovered that there had never been any    legal appropriation of money to support the Public Library other    than the original authorization by vote on May 6, 1901, which    allowed $ 2,500. annually for the support of a free library. It    was coincidental that about this time the Supreme Court of North    Carolina handed down rulings in connection with cases in Southern    Pines and in Wilmington that support of a library was "" not a    necessary public expenditure"" and therefore unconstitutional un­less    authorized specifically by a vote of the people. Hence, the    City Attorney declared that City and County authorities had no    legal right to appropriate tax money for the maintenance of the    Charlotte Public Library in excess of $ 2,500. annually, as they    had been doing for many years, and that they must discontinue    making such appropriations. Permission was sought and granted    by the State Legislature to hold a special election in the    County for the purpose of voting on a tax levy to provide funds    for the maintenance of the Public Library.    Through misunderstanding by the people, insufficient pub­licity    of the real issue, and the fact that the election was held    in a summer month ( June 27, 1939), and was a vote against the    registration, the measure failed to carry and the Charlotte Public    Library closed its doors on the evening of June 30, 1939 »    While the Library was closed, a petition to call another    election was circulated and was signed by about 7,000 citizens.    It was nearly a year before another election was held, May 25,    1940, and through the efforts of the Citizens Library Committee    of fifteen prominent citizens of Charlotte, the Parent- Teacher",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1354,1354,1355.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1355.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Library reopened its doors with an official ceremony    on July 1, 1940, with Mrs. Louella S. Posey, a former staff mem­ber,    as Acting Director, to serve until a permanent Director    could be found. The Brevard Street Branch was reopened with    fitting ceremonies on August 1, 1940 and the five town branches    were reopened during the fall of 1940.    Mr. Hoyt R. Galvin was chosen as Director and took up his    duties here on November 1, 1940.    In 1941 the Library began an Educational Film Service, pro­viding    projectors, 16mm. films and film advisory service to the    library clientele. Much of this work was done in cooperation    with and at the request of the Government's Office of War Infor­mation.    For their work in this connection, citations were award­ed    to Mr. Galvin, to the Head of the Film Department and to her    assistant by the Treasury Department's War Finance Division.    In 1943 the Library Board decided to employ an Assistant    Director who would also act as Head of the Reference Department.    In August, Mr. Charles R. Brockmann was employed to fill this    position.    The Audio- Visual service was carried on in the office of    the Executive Assistant who also acted as Head of the Film    Department, from 1941 until December 1946, when crowded con­ditions    and great increase in the volume of Audio- Visual ac­tivities    made it necessary to find larger quarters for the Film    Department. The Cataloguing Department and the Extension Office    were moved into the Auditorium; then the Film Department, here­after    to be called the Film and Sound Division, was moved across    the building into the former "" work room"" and files office; the    files ( pamphlet and clipping) were moved into the former Cata­loguing    Department space. At this time the name of the Catalog­uing    Department was changed to Technical Processes Department,    and the work of the Department includes the ordering of books    and all the preparations for circulation and use. The stage was    removed from the Auditorium to make more working and storage    space. After this there was no place provided by the Library    for public meetings.    During World War II a considerable part of the Library's    service was in connection with the Civilian Service Corps of    the Mecklenburg County Civilian Defense Council. A War Infor­mation    Center was established, and the Library began staying open    until midnight on Saturday nights and from 2 until 6 on Sunday    afternoons, especially to accomodate the service men who were in",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1355,1355,1356.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1356.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then the Library has continued    to stay open for reading and reference on Sunday afternoons    except during the summer months.    In the Spring of 1944 ( April) a Survey of the Library was    made under the supervision of the American Library Association.    This was financed jointly by the City of Charlotte and Mecklen­burg    County. The librarians appointed to make the Survey were    Dr. John Adams Lowe of Rochester, N. Y. and Miss Tommie Dora    Barker of Atlanta, Ga. The Survey report was accepted by the    Board of Trustees in their meeting on August 4, 1944.    PUBLIC LIBRARY OF CHARLOTTE AND MECKLENBURG COUNTY    In accordance with one of the recommendations of the Survey,    the North Carolina General Assembly of 1945 changed the name    of the Library officially to "" Public Library of Charlotte and    Mecklenburg County.""    The Survey recognized the crowded conditions in the Library    and recommended that the Trustees endeavor to procure a new    central library and some branch library buildings.    On April 23, 1946, an election was held on the question of    issuing $ 600,000.00 in bonds for new library buildings, and a    maximum of 5$ on the hundred dollars for operation of libraries    from the City and a like amount from the County. The bonds    for new buildings were to be shared equally by City and County.    Again the vote was against the registration and the measures    failed by a small majority.    Under Mr. Galvin's administration the policy of the Library    has been to emphasize the educational, informational, and cul­tural    aspects of its service rather than the recreational aspect    represented by light fiction. It is considered that it is the    function of the Library to provide information through many    other media of communication as well as through the printed page.    Accordingly, the lending of films, records, projectors of various    kinds, and record players has become a valued service of the    Library,    The lending of record albums was begun in December 1947 «    The nucleus of this service was a considerable gift of albums    by the Charlotte Music Club. From time to time the Library has    received additional gifts from the Charlotte Music Club, which    are a welcome supplement to the collection purchased by the    Library from its budget.    In October 1948, the Public Library received its first check    from the A. B. C. profits, and was able to plan for expanded ser­vices.    When the A. B. C. stores were authorized in Mecklenburg    County, the Legislature stipulated that the Public Library was    to receive 5% of the net profits.

Many of the former stations in homes, stores,    and filling stations and one branch ( for Negroes) and one sub-branch    ( for white people) were closed and made Mobile Library    stops.    With A. B. C. funds the Main Library and the Brevard Street    Branch were redecorated, fluorescent lights were installed in    Main and Brevard Street Branch, much of the furniture was re-finished,    and lounge furnishings ( couches and chairs) were pur­chased    for the Main Library, Brevard Street and the other    branches. All these agencies were thus made more comfortable    and attractive.    When television came to Charlotte July 14, 1950, the    Library immediately purchased a Television Receiver, had it    installed in the Children's Department, and was ready from the    beginning to give the public the advantage of this newest    medium of communication.    In February 1951 the Library received funds from the North    Carolina Library Commission to be used in building a special    textile collection which would be available for interlibrary    loan throughout North Carolina. Other libraries in the State    agreed to build collections in other specified subjects. The    Library has received additional funds from time to time for    this purpose and now has one of the best textile collections    in the South, including books and periodicals. A Bibliography    of the materials in the "" Textile Collection"" was issued in    June 1952.    The Library publishes annually a "" Directory of Clubs and    Organizations in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County"", and a book­let    of "" Program Suggestions for Clubs and Study Groups"", besides    bibliographies on special subjects at irregular intervals. The    annual report for 1950- 51, entitled "" Up from the Cellar"", was    a very effective piece of publicity and gained nation- wide at­tention.    In 1952 the Library is operating 22 agencies besides the    Main Library and the 2 mobile libraries, one of which makes 91    different service stops ( twice a month at most of them, four    times a month at a few) and the other 44 ( four times a month at    each place). The Library now has a total book stock ( as of    June 30, 1952) of 151,194 bound volumes, besides many thousand    yet unbound periodicals, about 44,000 uncatalogued pamphlets, 4,000 pictures and prints, 320 maps, 238 slides and filmstrips, 331 microfilm rolls, 350 16mm sound motion picture films, 984    sound recordings, and 101 microcard books. The Library System    currently receives 22 newspapers and 622 periodicals, excluding    duplicates. The population now served by the Library is 197,052    ( 1950 census).",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1357,1357,1358.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1358.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The property on the    northwest corner of Colonial Drive and Randolph Street known as the    Charles F. Lambeth homeplace was chosen as the location for the library's    new home. The completion and the moving into this building mark the be­ginning    of a high spot in the library's history; this is a day that will long be    remembered as tangible evidence of the type of accomplishment that is made    possible by a combination of private donations and county funds.    When plans for a new county building were being made in 1954 it was    suggested that the library be housed in the new county building now located    on West Guilford Street and dedicated on December 19, 1957. A local citi­zen,    and a friend of the library, J. Walter Lambeth, Jr.; began planning    for a separate building and through his interest a gift of $ 75,000 was made    by his sister, Mrs. Ernestine Lambeth Mobley and her son, Thomas Austin    Finch, Jr.; this gift with $ 45,000 adde3 from county funds allocated by the    Davidson County Board of Commissioners, made possible this beautiful    building. On May 1, 1956, announcement was made that plans were under    way for the construction of the Library's new home, which would be the    first county- owned library building in Davidson County.    The new building is a handsome modern structure with approxi­mately    6,000 square feet of floor area in contrast with the 1,900 square feet,    the library's old quarters in the City Hall. The overall dimensions are 100    feet by 71 feet, including an entrance court facing Randolph Street. The    building provides stacks for 20,000 books and adequate seating for readers.    The children's room is in the left wing, next to Colonial Drive. It has    one entire wall of glass looking out on the central open court around which    the structure was built. At the rear of the left wing is a club room which    is provided for story telling, films, meetings and discussion groups. It has    a separate entrance and has a seating capacity for 60 persons.    The adult reading room and stacks are in the right wing, which contains    a lounge area with easy chairs as well as reading tables. The exterior side    wall is of glass.    The front portion of the central section is a lounge area. The back    portion contains the circulation desk, the work room, the office, the staff    lounge, the periodical room and other service areas.    The basement houses the furnace room and a large storage area which    is being used to store back issues of magazines, newspapers and library    supplies.    The building, erected by John V. Barger and Company, Mooresville,    North Carolina, has local sand- faced brick walls, stone trim and steel sash    for the exterior and light- aggregate concrete block walls, acoustical tile    ceilings and asphalt tile floor coverings on the interior. Luther Lashmit of    Lashmit, James, Brown and Pollock of Winston- Salem was the architect.    Robert G. Campbell of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was the landscape archi­tect.    Interior furnishings supplied by Myrtle Desk, High Point, are of maple    with toffee finish. Lounge furniture is the Finch Furniture, Thomasville    Chair Company. Mrs. Ernestine Lambeth Mobley was the interior decorator",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2013-05-08,2013-05-08,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1434,1434,1431.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1431.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mrs. Mobley also    presented the statue, Prosperina.    The Thomasville Library, a branch of the Davidson County Public    Library, as well as the entire county system, has an interesting and unique    history in many ways. As a part of the entire county library system the    Thomasville Library derives its support from county taxes as authorized by    special vote in April, 1943. State Aid is a supplement to the county funds.    In the early struggles for funds the Rosenwald Foundation added a generous    amount to provide more and better library services. Miss Antoinette Earle,    Head Librarian for the county system, has her office in the Lexington    Library and is employed by the non- partisan library board appointed by the    county commissioners.    It was in 1928 that the National Federation of Women's Clubs in­corporated    the free public library movement in its program of projects.    With such inspiration and practical backing of the Woman's Club of    Thomasville and the Woman's Club of Lexington, the women of the two    towns decided to undertake a county- wide campaign for a free public library.    The response of approval from civic organizations, from city and county    governing bodies, and from hundreds of individual citizens was so great that    it proved beyond a doubt that the people were anxious for a public library.    Therefore, on August 6, 1928, the county commissioners appointed a library    board; a budget for the library was appropriated by the county com­missioners    and the governing bodies of Thomasville and Lexington. The    late James E. Lambeth, Sr., Thomasville, was at that time a member of the    board of county commissioners who led in advocacy for the establishment of    the library.    The Thomasville Branch was opened officially on October 25, 1928, with    a small collection of books housed at the high school with Mrs. Millie J.    Crowell as librarian. A little later it was moved to a small room on Com­merce    Street where the Record Shop is now located and Miss Anne Mebane    was the librarian. As the number of patrons was almost equal to the    number of books, only one book was allowed to each borrower.    In a few years the number of books had been so greatly increased that    the library was moved to a store space on Salem Street, now the location for    Lester's Dress Shop, and Miss Clara Johnson was the librarian. In 1936,    Miss Eloise Ward was employed as the first full- time trained librarian and    was succeeded the next year by Miss Elmina Hearne, who was librarian when    the library moved to its location in the City Hall in 1938. Miss Margaret    Eller succeeded Mrs. Elmina Hearne Surratt in 1940. Mrs. Margaret Eller    Julian was followed in 1943 by Miss Ada White. Mrs. Mary G. Matthews    became librarian in 1944, resigning in August, 1952, to become librarian    of the Hickory High School Library. Mrs. Matthews was succeeded by the    present librarian, Miss Mary Lee Crouse, who had been on the staff for    several years. On the staff with Miss Crouse at present are Mrs. W. T.    Green, Sr., as library assistant, and Miss Dorothy Beane as office assistant,    both having been employed in 1956. A number of part- time assistants have    been employed through the years but not until July, 1944, was the first full-",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2013-05-08,2013-05-08,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1435,1435,1432.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1432.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much credit for the steady, continuous, and increasing growth of the    entire system is due to the faithfulness of the library board, two members    from Thomasville, two from Lexington and two from the county at large;    two of the six being women. John R. Myers of Thomasville was the first    chairman of this board; he was succeeded in 1931 by James E. Lambeth, Sr.,    who served until 1943, when illness required his resignation. A number of    persons from Thomasville have served on the county board. Curtis Fields,    who succeeded Mr. Lambeth, remained on the board until October, 1947, when    he resigned and was replaced by E. F. Pepper. Upon Mr. Pepper's resigna­tion    in 1950, Mr. Fields again became a member of the library board; he was    elected chairman in September, 1957. Mrs. C. F. Finch was also an out­standing    Thomasville member of the library board, giving eighteen years of    service as secretary- treasurer. Mrs. Finch resigned in the fall of 1946 to    be succeeded by Mrs. J. S. Green. In 1950, Mrs. A. H. Ragan, Sr. replaced    Mrs. Green. Mrs. Ragan and Mr. Fields represent Thomasville at present.    The Thomasville Library has been more than a storehouse for books.    Story hours have been conducted for the children; the students have been    given information concerning the library through school visits. A planned    reading program is conducted each summer with the Thomasville Junior    Chamber of Commerce sponsoring the program. The library began dis­cussion    groups for adults in 1953 with the American Heritage program, and    other such groups have been held each year. The library is a service agency    used by a large number of people in and around Thomasville. During the    fiscal year ending June 30, 1957, the Thomasville Library loaned 75,822    books, magazines and other kinds of reading materials to 4,575 people    registered to borrow books.    The Thomasville Library has continuously received much consideration    from earlier local newspapers, from the Thomasville Tribune and the High    Point Enterprize in their allowance of space for library news. Radio    Station WMFR allowed the library a weekly five- minute broadcast as long    as it maintained a Thomasville studio. Station WTNC gives the library    two, fifteen- minute periods each week, on Mondays and Thursdays at 11    A. M. Transportation to and from the radio station is given by Hegler's    Taxi. Local merchants have also given the use of their window space for    posters and displays as requested. Thomasville citizens have ever been    mindful of the library.    Individuals and groups have given the library many memorial books and    also gifts of books and furnishings through the years. Mr. and Mrs. George    D. Finch have established a continuous fund which is to be used to purchase    books on gardening, flowers and reference books for young people. Mr. and    Mrs. Finch also presented the library the beautiful bronze and glass exhibit    case, a book display rack, and two lounge chairs. The library has an un­usual    collection of bronze medallions or medals of each president of the    United States, which was presented to the library by J. Walter Lambeth, Jr.    The Thomasville Rotary Club has just given more than 50 books; they are    establishing a book- a- month plan, whereby a current book will be given to",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2013-05-08,2013-05-08,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1436,1436,1433.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1433.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Thomasville Chair Company Representatives    have established a memorial fund to be used to purchase current books, as    they pay tribute to deceased men and women of the firm. The Thomasville    Junior Chamber of Commerce presented the library with funds to purchase    books for children on all grade levels. The Thomasville Business and Pro­fessional    Women's Club has donated a record player and records. Individuals    have also given records as gifts and as memorials.    Other outstanding gifts have been the set of the Encyclopedia Britan-nica    given by the Thomasville Junior Chamber of Commerce in memory of    Thomas L. Peacock and Aaron Pliskin, members of that organization who    gave their lives in World War II, and some 90 volumes given by the Amer­ican    Legion Auxiliary, a book inscribed in memory of each Thomasville    soldier lost in World War I and World War II. The Auxiliary is continuing    this practice as they add additional books as memorials for service men of    the Korean War and also replace copies of books that are now worn out from    constant use. Other substantial gifts of books have been made by J. Walter    Lambeth, Jr.; Mrs. J. W. Hawthorne, C. F. Lambeth, Jr. A music collection    as a memorial for Mildred Pennington Holman was established by Mr. and    Mrs. George D. Finch who have given individual books as memorials.

The library also has a large    number of books given by the Yow family and others in memory of Annie    Yow Rucker.    In the earlier days of the library Mr. Reid Whitford gave the library a    priceless set of 10 volumes of the North Carolina Colonial Records, as well    as other valuable old books. Individuals have given a book or more as a    gift or as a memorial for a friend or relative, these being too numerous to    mention, but received with great pride as they add to the library books of    information and entertainment.    The city of Thomasville quickly became conscious of the value of a    public library; the City Hall completed in April, 1938, included a wing    especially designed for the library.

The city officials and employees    have ever been mindful of the library in allowing full use of the City Hall    facilities. The Council Room has been used for discussion groups, the Court    Room for story hours and parties for the boys and girls, and machines or    office equipment needed has been available for staff use.

TO YOUR LIBRARY    The    Public Library of Winston- Salem    and Forsyth County Is Yours...    Use It for Pleasure and Profit    HISTORY: On February 16, 1906, the Carnegie Public Library, with    2,500 volumes, was opened to the citizens of Winston. The building,    located at Third and Cherry Streets, was a gift of Andrew Carnegie.    The cities of Winston and Salem were merged in 1913; at that time,    the Carnegie Public Library became the public library for Winston-    Salem. Through the years, the population increased from approximately    10,000 in 1906 to 146,135 ( population of City and County, area served    by the library) in 1950. In 1950 a movement was started to improve    the library service by improving the physical facilities. Private funds    were solicited by the board chairman for a new main library building    and a Negro branch. As soon as funds were in sight for the new    building, a library book fund campaign was started. A fund of approxi­mately    $ 160,000 was raised for books. The construction of the new    main library began on January 2, 1952, and the building was dedicated    on March 26, 1953, and opened to the public the following day. The    2,500 volumes have grown to 65,000 volumes in 1954. In January    1954 construction began on a branch building for the Negro patrons;    this building was completed and dedicated on November 14, 1954.",2008-09,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1460,1460,1457.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1457.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Your library card is your KEY to the storehouse of recorded knowledge in your    community.    We have BOOKS whether for inspiration, information or relaxation. We    have more than 60,000 books to choose from. If we do not have the book you    want on hand, we will consider it for purchase, or we can borrow certain    materials from other libraries. Adults may borrow any reasonable number of    books at any one time. The loan period for most books is 28 days. New and    popular books are limited to 14 days. A fine of 2 cents a day is charged for    each book kept overtime. Children have the same privilege of borrowing    books as mother and dad.    REFERENCE AND RESEARCH is yours too!    Were you ever "" stumped"" for the answer to a question? The library    has hundreds of reference books in the form of dictionaries, encyclopedias,    handbooks, periodical indexes ( more than 400 magazines) atlases, gazetters,    state and federal documents, pamphlets and newspapers. The local newspapers    and the N. Y. Times are on microfilm, with a reader available to the public.    If you cannot make the trip to the library, call 5- 3551, and the less involved    questions will be answered over the telephone; for others, the material will    be located and held for the patron.    PHONOGRAPH RECORDS may be borrowed for home use or played in    the library. The record collection contains symphonies, operas, folk dances,    classical and semi- classical, in both 33V3 and 78 rpm. There are records for    the children in the children's department. A small service fee is charged for    records.    FILMS AND FILM STRIP ( Main Library Only) will add color and pep to    your next club meeting. The library now has a small, but well chosen collection    of films and film strip. The library receives 6- 8 films per month through a film    pool, and with advance notice, films can be provided in a wide range of sub­jects,    for a small charge. All films are 16 mm, and filmstrips are 35 mm. Adult    films are for organized groups. Juvenile films are for group and home showing.    Adult and juvenile films are not loaned for classroom use. The library does    not loan or rent movie or film strip projectors.    STORY AND MUSIC HOUR FOR CHILDREN. The story and music hours    have become very popular with the children. The hours and days of the week    vary with the seasons. During the Fall, Winter and Spring, the hours are    3: 30- 4: 30, Tuesday ( 4, 5, and 6 years olds), Wednesday, 3: 30- 4: 30 ( 7, 8, 9, and    10 year olds). During the Summer, the hours are 10: 30- 11: 30. Tuesday ( 4, 5,    and 6 year olds), Wednesday ( 7, 8, 9 and 10 year olds).    The children are sometimes taken on a trip through storyland; at other    times they are shown movies. During the summer months the children between    the ages of 4- 12 have had an activity program of simple folk dances, games    and folk songs. Members of the Junior League not only give their volunteer    services in assisting with this program, but contribute funds with which to    purchase juvenile films and records. East Winston Branch has story hours also.",2008-09,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1461,1461,1458.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1458.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VOTES for each of the 3 bond issues MUST be cast SEPARATELY.    BE SURE to vote YES on the LIBRARY bond issue!    HERE ARE THE FACTS:    1. ? ? ? ?    2. One out of every 7 persons in Lenoir County    is a Library user.    3. Insufficient and inadequate facilities for work    with our young people and children.    4. Space to serve 4 people has to do for 25!    Crowded conditions make it impossible to serve    the public effectively. People are jostled;    passageways are blocked during rush hours,    and access to books and bookshelves is impeded.    5. Uninterrupted reading and concentrated study    is impossible under present conditions. Insuf­ficient    number of tables and chairs for use of    readers, students and research workers.    6. Present book stock is 3/ 4ths of a book per    person in entire County.    7. No room in which to show films, have important    exhibits, hear music, have a storytelling hour,    or to use for community groups and meetings.    8. BATHTUB now being used as storage place    for valuable reference materials.    AN ADEQUATE LIBRARY    BUILDING WOULD PROVIDE:    1. Pride in a building representing an informational    and cultural center in Lenoir County.    2. Adequate room would lead to a ratio of 1 person    in every 3 ( the national average) thereby raising    the level of intelligence to the benefit of everyone.    3. The formative years of young people are ALL    important to the future life of our county. The    Public Library must play a STRONG part in    developing habits of thoughtful consideration    and understanding of human problems.    4. Room to permit free flow of traffic; workrooms    for library work to be carried on efficiently. A    Public Library should be a place of activity    carried on in an atmosphere of serenity, cheer­fulness    and good will.    5. Surroundings would be conductive to study and    reading for the acquisition of information,    knowledge and understanding in the "" PEOPLE'S    UNIVERSITY."" Patrons will not be driven    away because of physical discomforts.    6. The standard of 2 books per person could be    achieved with adequate shelving space.    7. A multi- purpose room for Library and public    activities would be profitable and inspirational.    8. Necessary reference material ( now inaccessible    because of poor storage facilities) would be    made useful.

She then wrote letters to the Mayors of each town, inviting then: to participate. The    towns of Lucana ( township population 2,934) and Stantonsburg ( township population 2,050)    were most enthusiastic and with the support of key persons there the dream of branch    libraries in Wilson County became a reality in a very short ti- ne.    Stantonsburg Branch was formed first. A Library Gorcrittee was selected which was    made up of representatives from the three civic clubs of the town. This committee is    composed of nine members and has adopted a constitution. That the committee is most    conscientious and efficient is shown in the prompt manner in which it was able to    secure suitable quarters for the library and. to build up support for it in the town.    The building which was chosen for the Stantonsburg Branch was one which was    formerly used as a grocery store and a cafe. It was in a sad state of disrepair, but    it is located in a most advantageous spot, in the center of the business district, and    the owner made it available rent free upon the cancellation of city taxes. The Town    Board voted $ 350 to be used for repairs and furnishings. Shelving was supplied at    cost by a local mill and furniture, a desk, table and five chairs, was acquired through    war curplus. The cement floor had no covering, so inlaid linoleum was purchased at    cost, from a local furniture store, kbits Venetian blinds were obtained through the    same source. The attractive green figured curtains, complementing the ^ resn walls,    were made by a member of the Library Committee. Heat, a gas heater, was secured by    another member of the committee, as was a large peg board for displays. Last to bo    installed was a white sign, projecting ovar the front, door, which proudly proclaims the    words "" Stantonsburg Library"" in bold black letters.",2008-05,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1472,1472,1469.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1469.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Service was inaugurated on October 17, 1957. An open li= use was held, with the    Library Coranittee serving as host. The branch is o^- en on Konuays and Thursdays from    two until five in the afternoon. Two story hours have been held and another one Is    being planned for the near future.    The Lueama Branch came into beln: chiefly through the efforts of one roan, Mayor    riichard Ham. He It was who persuaded the Town Board to make available a spacious,    beautifully appointed room in the new Municipal Building for the library quarters.    He It was, also, who secured expensive, custom- built shelving, and he it was who    donated the mayor's own desk and chair for the use of the librarian. Mayor Ham,    at the suggestion of Miss Gray, has appointed a Library Committee of five persons.    These people have made themselves available for help when the need arises and are    doing much to promote corarunity inter t in the library. The Lucaraa ""'.' rent Teachers    Association has also exprensed vital interest in the project.    The Lucarra Branch opened on November 20, 1957. The Lucaraa Home Demonstrntion    x Club served as hostess and a very deli-' htful open house was held to nark the occasion.    The branch is open on Tuesdays and Fridays from two until five. A Christmas story    hour was held on December 17.    Federal funds amounting to 1,500 for each branch are being used to purchase    books. The book collections have been supplemented liberally by books from the shelves    of the main library. There are at present about 1,200 books at each branch, and a    regular exchange of books from the county library collection to the two branches is    maintained by visits of the bookmobile to the branches.    All ordering, cataloging and processing is don © by the Wilson County Public    Library which also furnishes supplies. A trained librarian, whose salary is paid    with Federal funds, mans both branches. This librarian was also made available by    the ilson County Public Library.",2008-05,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1473,1473,1470.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1470.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What are we voting on? ,    A. For or against the levy of a special tax of    not more than five cents on the Hundred    Dollars of the assessed value of the taxable    property in the county, for the support of    the Caldwell County Free Public Libraries.    Q. Why is this election necessary?    A. The Supreme Court of North Carolina has    ruled that ad valorem tax money — that    is, taxes derived from a levy on real or    personal property — cannot be used for    the support of libraries without the    authority of the people.    Q. How has the Library been supported in the    past?    A. - The State of North Carolina and Caldwell    County have provided $ 3600 each, the City    of Lenoir provided $ 3000, and approxi­mately    $ 4000 was given by Civic Clubs    and other interested agencies.    Q. What funds has the County been using in    the past to provide its $ 3600 allotment to    the Library?    A. Revenue from beer and wine tax. Since    beer and wine were voted out of the    County, there are no non- tax funds avail­able    for the Library.    Q. Will the entire five cents be levied if    authorized ?    A. We are voting to authorize a levy of    NOT MORE THAN five cents in order to    insure adequate funds for future opera­tions.    The Board of County Commissioners    can, at their discretion, levy any amount    up to five cents per $ 100 valuation. But    no one intimately connected with Library    affairs expects that it will be necessary in    the near future to levy more than 2 or 3    cents for operating expenses.",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1478,1478,1476.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1476.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Q. Will taxes be raised? -    A. It is quite possible that for the next few    years our tax rate will remain the same,    even though this special levy will be    authorized by the voters. The present    Board of County Commissioners has al­ready    indicated that the operating funds    equivalent to the 2 or 3 cents levied can    be supplied without raising taxes in the    foreseeable future.    7. Q. Why, then, is it necessary to authorize the    special levy if funds can be supplied with­out    raising taxes?    A. As mentioned previously, the Supreme    Court of North Carolina has ruled that    taxes on real and personal property can­not    be used for the support of libraries    without the authority of the people. By    voting Yes on this issue you are simply    authorizing the County Commissioners to    use tax money for the support of our    libraries. Taxes will not necessarily have    to be raised. As a matter of fact, they will    probably remain the same for some time    to come.    8. Q. What will happen to the Library if this    election fails?    A. The County's allotment will, of course, be    discontinued, and the State support will be    stopped automatically. Therefore, the    Library and all its services Vvill have to be    closed down permanently. The books, the    Bookmobile, and all Library equipment will    have to be sold at a fraction of its original    cost to the taxpayers of Caldwell County.    9. Q. What will happen to the Library if the    election is successful?    A. The Board of County Commissioners will    appoint a Library Commission to ad­minister    the affairs of the Library. There    will be a set income, without those fluctua­tions    from year to year which have so    distressed the Library in the past. It will    become even more of a County- wide    Library than it is now, with all branches    being strengthened.",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1479,1479,1477.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1477.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Q. How are the public Libraries in other    counties financed?    A. Largely by taxation. Sometimes the tax is    supplemented by funds derived from beer    and wine, ABC stores, and parking meters,    but the growing trend is to put libraries    on a solid financial basis through taxation.    11. Q. Is the Library widely used by the people    of the County?    A. Yes. The circulation of all branches of the    Library combined has increased almost    33 1/ 3% in the last ten years.    12. Q. Is the Library necessary to the schools of    the County?    A. Superintendent of County Schools C. M.    Abernethy has said that che services the    Libraries perform for the schools of the    County are of immeasurable value both    to the teachers and the pupils. Since the    turn of the century, teaching methods have    changed. The teachers in our schools now    expect their students to make use of the    Library in preparing their assignments.    The Library rooms are filled to capacity    every afternoon after school closes, filled    with students doing research for their next    day's work. If the Public Library were not    available to these school children, the    schools would have to maintain their own    libraries at a cost far greater than it takes    to run the County Library.    13. Q. What are the other services the Library    performs ?    A. 1. The Bookmobile travels to every sec­tion    of the County every 3 weeks. It    also serves all the County schools.    2. Movie films and a sound projector are    available at the Library.    3. Phonograph records of all speeds and    all types may be borrowed.    4. The Library subscribes to 60 magazines    and 3 daily papers.

The devotion, affection and zeal with    which library service has been promoted through the years might well be an example    to many other counties even today. A strong, abiding belief in the value of good    library service expressed itself early in the establishment of community libraries    ( Reidsville - 1909), in the gift of the B. Frank Mebane Memorial Library ( Leaksville    June, 1930) and of the first book truck given in Mr. Mebane's memory ( August, 1937),    the garage to house the truck, as well as numerous other donations of time, money    and materials.    This devotion of individuals connected with library service in Rockingham    County is even written in the record of the state's library history. Col. Frank P.    Hobgood, Jr., Reidsville, was the first chairman of the North Carolina Citizens'    Library Movement in 1927, devoting his time and energies not only to the library of    his native Reidsville, but to the state as a whole. Col. Hobgood must have inspired    his co- workers. The North Carolina Library Bulletin ( September, 1930) reported "" The    earnestness and fighting spirit of the members of this group who returned to their    communities to promote the library movement are pointed up by the fact that library    income per capita in North Carolina doubled ( from 4 to 8 cents) in the next two    years and there was an increase from 6 to 11 books per 100 people while only 35% of    the people ( compared to 46$ previously) had no access to a library.""    In 1934 Mrs. Laura Abbott, Leaksville librarian, convinced that all the people    of Rockingham County needed and ought to have books available, asked the Board of    County Commissioners for ^ 2,000 to distribute books throughout the county. The    Board voted $ 1,500 during the depths of the depression to begin the work. A modest    50 books were exchanged four times a year at Reidsville, Madison, Ruffin, Bethany,    and Stoneville. Though difficulties and drawbacks arose, the record reports that    "" the invaluable end has been achieved of making Rockingham County library- minded",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2013-05-08,2013-05-08,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1496,1496,1494.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1494.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Madison library promoters soon caught the vision of the benefits of cooperation.    Citizens agreed that "" Rather than maintain in Madison a town library and a branch of    the County Library, the books owned by Madison are to be incorporated into the County    system. In return Madison will have access to more County Library books. We will    have a strong branch of the County system instead of our divided system."" ( 1938)    So devoted was Mrs. Abbott that she traveled over the county at her own expense    to exchange the books. Not until 1936 could she begin to be reimbursed by the    Library.    When she retired in March, 1937, Mrs. Abbott had the satisfaction of having a-chieved    another milestone in the dedication of the Rockingham County Library. It    opened February 11, 1937, with Dr. Frank Graham, president of the University of    North Carolina, as guest speaker. History records that as of that date "" Rockingham    County ranked high in relation to other libraries in the state in size, plant faci­lities,    book stock, trained librarian and service to the whole county but fell low    in salary rating, paying the librarian but $ 100 a month and the assistant $ 50.""    Following Mrs. Abbott, Miss Cecil Elizabeth Ward became librarian on May 1, 1937,    for one year and then left to be married. Miss Marianne Read Martin succeeded Miss    Ward on May 1, 1938, and continued until she resigned for health reasons in 1956.    During the one year that Miss Ward was in charge she "" began to organize a    county service out of what had been essentially a town set- up. From the first the    County Library had worked in and through other libraries but transportation had    always been a problem.""

The worst of the depression had hit the county. Miss Martin worked without    salary for a time. Bookmobile service was halted. The Leaksville News protested:    "" Perhaps no single agency in the county ( certainly not for a similar amount of    money) was doing more potential good than the bookmobile. Had the work of this    agency not been interrupted, it is probable it would have definitely fastened the    reading habit on thousands who had not before acquired it. To interfere with a work    of this sort was nothing less than tragic. It was like burning down the school house    to save teacher hire."" ( 21 Sept. 1939)    Again citizens' interest assured the continuance of the service. A total of    $ 1,000 in public gifts was matched by $ 1,000 from the County Commissioners. Eventu­ally    the Commissioners began to increase the Library's budget, putting the bookmobile    back into operation on July 1, 1940.    During the period of Miss Martin's administration there was probably nothing in    the books on library service, community service and publicity that was not attempted    by the Rockingham County Library. In 1940, special groups of books were purchased    and placed as permanent collections in Reidsville, Madison, Mayodan and Stoneville.    The McRae libraries were named in honor of J. A. McRae, an outstanding Negro    educator. Hospital library service was begun. During several summers story hours    were conducted at various community libraries.    In November, 1944, the first Fine Arts Festival staged in the county was spon­sored    by the Rockingham County Library with the assistance of the Leaksville- Spray    Junior Women's Club in order to encourage writing, painting, drawing, musical compo­sitions    and the like. This was the origin of the Fine Arts Festival Association    which was formed October 22, 1947.    As early as 1947 the lending of music records for home use was begun.

TWENTY YEARS AFTER    The present survey report, appearing approximately twenty years after the    beginning of Miss Martin's administration, is to carry forward the "" one great goal:    BETTER LIBRARY SERVICE FOR ROCKINGHAM COUNTY PEOPLE"" which she stressed in her    TENTATIVE PLANS, 1952- 1962. That the recommendations will differ in part from those    she outlined is due more to rapidly changing conditions in library administration    and county government today than to any change in emphasis. Indeed, the point cannot    be emphasized strongly enough that any and all recommendations made in the following    pages have "" better library service for Rockingham County people"" as the underlying    thought and are practical, not theoretical in nature.    Survey Method Used    In studying current library services and practices in Rockingham County,    November 4 to 12, 1957, the surveyor depended chiefly on conferences, interviews,    first- hand observation and reading. Every community library was visited and dis­cussions    were held with members of local library committees and citizens, with    County Commissioners and officials, school officials, former and present library    employees, members of the Advisory Committee and library trustees, civic and com­munity    club members, newspaper and businessmen. Bookmobile service was studied    first- hand and through reports.    Thanks to the History of the Rockingham County Library. 1930- 1955 by Sunshine    Burchell Murphy ( 1956) it was possible to get an excellent overall review of the    library's beginnings.

For these busy people a survey    is a time- consuming, sometimes nerve- wracking undertaking.    Basic Assumptions    Basic assumptions on which the following study will be developed are:    1. Citizens' support can still be counted on in Rockingham County.    2. County officials are sincerely interested in promoting a sound library service,    just as they seek to promote sound governmental services in general.    3. A county- wide library system, a chain of library service points working together,    sharing their services and materials to meet all the needs of their communities,    is the desired goal for Rockingham County.    4. A sound organizational pattern of library service promotes efficiency; efficiency    promotes better service and allows the most profitable use of the tax dollar.    5. For a smoothly running, efficient organization the lines of authority must be    clear and distinct.    6. "" Democratic rights and privileges"" are readily preserved when citizens work    together toward one common goal - "" better library service for Rockingham County.""    Principles    To these basic assumptions must be added some definite principles which will    guide the development of a suggested program of action.    1, Library service means more than counted circulation and comprises the wide range    of modem public library service outlined in the new Public Library Service    standards, i. e. reference and research services, recordings and films, and the    many other activities carried on by the Rockingham County Library in times past    and at present.",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2013-05-08,2013-05-08,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1501,1501,1499.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1499.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of books is more important than ownership.    3. Not all library activities are of equal importance to the reader. He is most    immediately concerned with the personal and professional services available to    him in his library - or bookmobile - and with the adequacy of the total book    stock at his disposal through a chain or system of libraries.    4. A centralization of non- public administrative and technical routine services    frees the local librarian in the community and permits her to pay closer atten­tion    to more urgent tasks, such as community contacts and readers advisory    service.

Community libraries in Draper, Madison, Mayodan, Reidsville and Stoneville also    have local library committees. They vary in number of members. Madison and Mayodan    have three each.

The Leaksville, Madison, Reidsville and Stoneville libraries, each very different    from the other, are on the whole well located and suited to the community. There    are problems, of course. The Leaksville Library would be used more were it located    closer to the business center. The Madison Library, very well situated, needs to    add a room. The McRae- Madison Library's new quarters are up- to- date and very    inviting. The Mayodan Library, occupying quarters furnished free of charge by    Washington Mills, is an attractive small building located in a residential area and    somewhat off the beaten path. It also has space trouble. The Reidsville Library,    notable for its skillful renovation and excellent use of modern colors and furnish­ings,    has "" wide open spaces"" requiring much walking by the staff. The effect on the    user, however, is favorable. Quarters of the McRae- Reidsville Library were seen    during the evening dinner hour and seemed somewhat hard to find for a stranger.    They, too, are attractive, the displays being especially noticeable. The McRae-    Leaksville Library, functioning as the headquarters for McRae books, is larger for    this reason.    The Draper Library, occupying a very small room in the basement of the Draper    YMCA building, is severely handicapped. First, it must be reached via a steep,    dark- at- night stairway outside of the building and then the room is so crowded that    it is totally inadequate for the size of Draper.    County Headquarters    Of all the ouarters seen, those of the County Library office and headquarters    are the most inefficient. Space which was adequate twenty years ago is far from    that now. Perhaps it was never really suitable if the truth were known. There is    not even any hot water available in the building, a need that every staff member    mentioned.

As much as possible has been done in the present quarters to promote    proper work- flow in selecting, ordering and processing of books. Book stacks have    been added until it is hard to move around. Files and records have been handled as    well as can be expected. Some of the personnel has no desk or only a makeshift, A    small garage far from the headquarters building has been rented for additional    storage space. The extremes in temperature between summer and no heat in winter are    highly detrimental to the books stored there.    Most inefficient of all is the loading and unloading of the two bookmobiles.    The Rockingham County Library has little enough money in its salary fund, yet much    of the time and energy of bookmobile librarians and drivers are wasted in running    up and down stairs, carrying piles of books in arms or baskets. There is no loading    ramp. The bookmobiles stand 30 or more feet away from the basement quarters in a    metal garage building. This is especially aggravating in inclement weather when    books must be carried in and out of the garage when loading the bookmobiles.    The Leaksville Library building was given to the County of Rockingham on    March 17, 1949&gt; "" for such time as it will be continued to be used as a library    building.""

This McRae bookmobile was serving 4    schools and 8 community stops as well as the McRae libraries in Madison and    Reidsville.    The bookmobile for whites was serving 10 schools, 8 community stops, 38 deposit    stations and 19 private stops. No definite time schedule, as is customary in book­mobile    service, had been worked out at the time of the visit. A complete re- evalu­ation    of the bookmobile service pattern was under consideration and was begun shortly    afterwards.    Books and Library Materials    By 1957 County Library records showed a total of 70,654 books owned, a little    more than half the number desirable in modern library service in a county of this    size. Actually this total was a paper figure, as many of the books were worn out    or too obsolete to use. In addition, lost and missing books needed to be withdrawn    from the official records.    Most noticeable was the lack of a wide variety of modern reference materials.    Rockingham County's library system needs to have the various information sources    available somewhere in the chain of libraries.    To the inadequate book stock and the lack of reference materials a third woe    must be added. The very unfortunate practice of "" anchoring"" books in specific com­munity    libraries, started in 1940, had become a Hydra- headed monster. "" Anchoring""    deprives citizens of one of the cardinal advantages of belonging to a county- wide    library system, namely, a rapid exchange of a wide variety of titles.    A progressive step in supplying the constant demand for more or less ephemeral    fiction and non- fiction had been taken at the time of the survey. The County Library-was    subscribing to a book rental service. This increasingly popular procedure per­mits    libraries to select the books chosen for temporary use. The company exchanges    books on a definite schedule, much as the County Library exchanges books in branches",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2013-05-08,2013-05-08,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1506,1506,1504.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1504.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The film exchange service, happily available to the citizens of North Carolina    through their libraries, is also now available to the citizens of Rockingham County,    The service is obviously being enjoyed as the surveyor had occasion to observe.    Cataloging, Registration and Related Matters    Though the Rockingham County Library has been in existence for well over 20    years, there are still evidences that the library program itself has not "" jelled.""    This has no doubt been due to lack of staff and funds and the pressures of constant    demands.    There is no complete listing of all books to be found in the library system.    There is no union catalog of the community libraries either white or Negro. There    can be little intelligent book buying without knowing what is already available in    the county unless one constantly buys only the latest publications. Neither is there    any way of knowing how many copies of a single title are owned by the libraries in    the county.    Secondly, one of the great advantages of a county- wide library system lies in    the fact that borrowers can make use of any library within the county - an inter­change    of borrowers' privileges. At present borrowers are still registered at each    branch, there is no central registration system and little use is made of inter-library    borrowing.    Finally, much duplication exists at present in the matter of library bookkeeping,    buying of supplies and other business details. This lessens or eliminates the savings    that can result from unified procedures and wholesale buying.    Personnel    The problem of adequate personnel, well qualified and suited to the tasks to be    done, is doubtless the thorniest in promoting improved library service.

At the time of the study, the Rockingham County Library had lost 50% of its    professionally trained staff. The county librarian was the only remaining staff    with professional training. The Library lacked five trained librarians for county-wide    service.    No trained librarian had been added to the staff for several years. Miss    Martin's Tentative Plans. 1952- 1962 stressed that more professional help was needed    for both adult and youth service. North Carolina's State Library Board offers to    the county or regional library employing additional trained help a Personnel Grant    of $ 1,200 for two years. This should have induced library leaders in Rockingham    County to seek out some young people in Rockingham County to obtain the necessary    training.    The present personnel was found to be most willing, loyal, friendly and appa­rently    interested in improving their services both at headquarters and in the com­munity    libraries. No in- service training had been carried on for lack of time, help    and money. Yet if the County Library is to continue to grow and develop its services,    its personnel needs guidance and counseling.    Personnel has other problems, too.

Six years ago Miss Martin had recommended a Classification    and Pay Plan for the library staff but at the time of the study this had not yet been    accomplished. Lacking such a standard Classification and Pay Plan as used in some    North* Carolina counties, regular pay increases for the staff are unknown.    The morale of the staff at the time of the survey was found to be good both in    headquarters and in the community libraries. This is a tribute to the quality of    the staff now in the service of the County Library. All had been passing through a    very difficult period. First came the adjustment to a new administrator after having    worked under Miss Martin's administration for 18 years. Then the County Library to    which many of them had given years of devoted service came "" under fire"" so to speak.    It should be a comfort to these staff members to know that their single- minded    objective to keep the quality of the service to their patrons as high as possible    certainly was noticeable during the survey. At no point and from no individual was    any criticism of a library employee heard. This is most unusual in the surveyor's    experience.    Finances    From the time that the tax was voted for County Library support in 1945    to the present, the only increase in funds received by the Library has come about    through an increase in assessed valuations in Rockingham County, Also, a 5%    collection charge by the County against the County Library fund was fortunately    reduced to 1% in 1957.    Apparently neither the Board of Library Trustees, the county librarian nor    citizens in general were able to convince the Board of County Commissioners in recent    years that the value of the library's dollar has also changed since 1945, As    businessmen county officials certainly must know that book costs have doubled in    some cases and that trained librarians today command "" scarce item"" salaries.

Serious confusion exists in picturing the true cost of library service in the    county. This is caused by a multiplicity of reports from the five community libraries    with no accounting of the cost of library service in Leaksville. Though the County    Library budget shows all salaries being allocated to "" county staff,"" service to the    citizens of the Leaksville- Spray area accounts for 22- 25$ at present. This figure    would be lower were all positions now open in county service filled.    The secretary- treasurer of each individual community library committee dupli­cates    the accounting work that could be done more rapidly and with less confusion    for the entire library system in a central office. In only one community library was    an estimated budget for 1957- 58 seen. Fine monies are listed only for the Leaksville    Library. There seemed to be no uniformity in handling these small but still "" public""    funds in the various community libraries. Another anomaly exists in the fact that    community libraries claim ownership of the books "" anchored"" there.

This was noticed repeatedly    during the visit. Good public relations, built up over a long period, culminates    in public support in times of crises. Miss Martin and her staff had bent every    effort to achieve good service for Rockingham County and thereby had developed in    the minds of the citizens of Rockingham County a feeling that the library's program    was sound. This was expressed repeatedly by many people in different parts of the    county. Most of them were also aware that within a period of 20- 25 years revisions,    adjustments and alterations need to be made. If they are not carried through, the    most favorable public relations, so carefully and devotedly built up, will suffer.    The library's publicity during 1956- 57 was in part highly unfavorable. Credit    must be given for the fact that personalities were not involved, and that emphasis    was placed on improving service. Strife costs time, money and energy especially on    the part of the library administration and staff. There are too few persons availa­ble    now to do all the constructive work that needs to be done; so it is hoped that    the critics, with often justifiable complaints on their side, will henceforth bend    every effort to carry out the recommendations found in the survey and any other    constructive suggestions that may develop in the future.    The library's present administrator, Miss . Margaret Johnston, has made a special    study of "" working with adults"" and is one of North Carolina's outstanding leaders in    this field. Her competence should encourage even more and better publicity through    ' newspapers, the radio and by any other means. •    PROGRAM FOR FUTURE LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT    Several guiding principles regarding any program for future library develop­ment    in Rockingham County should be reemphasized.

In 1947- 48 the assessed valuation of the    county was $ 78,672,000. Ten years later it had risen to $ 152,000,000. The popu­lation    figure shows the same healthy growth.    1937- 38 - 44,232    1947- 48 - 57,898    1957- 53 - 64,816 ( Estimate - 67,000 to 69,000)    Taxable wealth increased from $ 1,800 to $ 2,300 per person in the last decade.    Industry has been sufficiently diversified, chiefly tobacco and textiles, and    has been established long enough to have proved that its leadership has been good    as well as being community minded on the whole. True, the Southern Railroad entered    a suit in Rockingham County in 1941 questioning the legality of the use of tax money    for the operation of a bookmobile by a public library. The railroad claimed that    "" such service did not constitute a necessary public expense."" Citizens not only in    Rockingham County but all over the state rose up and the suit was dropped.    There is something much more important than trying to prove through facts and    figures that the people of Rockingham County can afford to pay for improved library    service. That is to test again their devotion to the ideal of "" books and reading    for all,"" including the films and records they are using from their libraries today.    Good library service is a commodity just as are good highways and citizens get what    they pay for.    The 3- cent tax levied after a 3- cent to 5- cent tax was voted in 1945 has never    been raised to meet increasing costs. It is questionable whether the sum was really    sufficient even in 1945.

Until the year before Miss Martin left her salary never exceeded $ 3,750 -    and that in a period when "" green"" library school graduates could command $ 4,000 per    year.    An abiding belief in the value of good modern library service was still apparent    in Rockingham County during the surveyor's visit. The question, "" What do we need to    do?"" was asked much more frequently than "" How much will it cost?"" Both government    and industry today are aware of the direct relationship between healthy community    life and the status of library service. In the states of Alabama, Tennessee,    Mississippi and others where there is definite wooing of industry to come south,    the quality of library service is being stressed more and more. In Mississippi,    poorest of all states, numerous counties are levying the full permissible tax rate    for their library service, up to 20 cents on the $ 100 of assessed valuation in some    cases, compared to the minimum 3- cent tax currently available in Rockingham County.    Growth in Administrative Understanding    To the growing realization that good library service is "" worth buying"" from a    civic, economic and industrial standpoint must be added an increasing understanding    by government officials. Library service is also the business of county government,    just as are parks, airports, roads, bridges and the like.    In interviews with County Commissioners and other county officials the surveyor    sensed a keen interest and a willingness to participate helpfully in improving,    streamlining and modernizing the county's library service. This is growth in ad­ministrative    understanding and should prove of great value to the future development    of the County Library.

Library Quarters    Every businessman knows that the first requirement for efficient operation lies    in having proper working quarters however simple and unassuming they may be. So the    first recommendation for the improvement of the Rockingham County Library deals with    its housing.    It is recommended that the Board of County Commissioners and the    Board of Library Trustees set about forthwith to find suitable,    single- level housing for the County Library headquarters. These    ought preferably to be at or near Wentworth in order to be closer    to other county government offices.    Many of the problems which beset the County Library at present will be solved    through proper quarters, chiefly, being able to do the work that needs to be done    without waste of time or energy.

A former dwelling does not make    suitable quarters. Much better a large, converted store building with wide- open    spaces where work can be laid out as in a wholesale house.    It is recommended that the present headquarters building in    Leaksville be returned to the City of Leaksville for maintenance    as soon as the County Library moves out.    Space on the lower floor can easily be converted into a suitable children's    room and a small meeting room. Citizens of the Leaksville- Spray area are now denied    these rooms because of the presence of the County Library offices in the basement.    For the Mayodan Library    it is recommended that more signs and greater publicity    be used to overcome the handicap of location.    Signs on the nearest main street directing attention to the library, a large sign on    the lawn or parking in front of the library, and constant news about the library in    the newspaper, on bulletin boards and otherwise will publicize the library. Before    the quarters are completely outgrown, the question of location should be restudied.    The local library committee at Draper is fully aware of the housing problem    of its library but for the sake of clarity    it is recommended that the Draper library committee organize a    campaign for more adequate, ground- floor level quarters.    A campaign for an improved library has often unified and solidified citizen community    interest. That can also happen at Draper despite present problems.

Library Government    Most American libraries are governed by Boards of Library Trustees, The    effectiveness of that government depends not so much on length of service as on the    vision of what the library can and should accomplish. This presupposes skillful    planning together with the administrator on how the vision can be accomplished. It    also means assisting the administrator in carrying out the adopted plans adroitly    and persuasively for the benefit of all citizens.    Assisting the administrator to carry out the projected plans is furthered    materially by such factors as:    a. an understanding of the time required for certain jobs such as numerous    reports and the lack of staff available;    b. a willingness to study new ideas of library service through reading,    discussion, visits and observation;    c. a consideration of the Library's services always as county- iiri. de and    a thorough familiarity with all outlets throughout the county, not    merely those in the local community;    d. a readiness to carry out an interpretive public relations program with    the administrator, not leaving the burden on that person's shoulders;    e. a cooperative approach toward the administrator, the entire Board of    Trustees, local library committees, the staff, county and local officials,    radio and the press;    f. a feeling of responsibility on the part of each individual Board member    to represent the Library in communities throughout the county.    The following recommendations are made in full knowledge of the fact that there    is nothing in North Carolina library law which would force a Board of Library Trustees    to accept these recommendations.

No member may serve more than two terms of six    years each with a two- year lapse between the first    and second term. ( This will offer more library-minded    citizens throughout the county the privilege    of serving their library as trustees.)    2. No member of the Board of Library Trustees may be a member    of a local library committee. Such a member, to avoid    any suspicion of favoritism, must first resign from the    local library committee before the appointment to the    Board of Trustees becomes effective.    3. Offices of the Board shall rotate annually so that    members of the Board may become thoroughly familiar    with Board responsibilities during their term of office.    If these stipulations are incorporated into the By- Laws and voluntarily observed    in all good faith, many more residents of Rockingham County will be better acquainted    with and become greater supporters of their tax- supported Library.

They are to be commended for their skill in handling difficult situations.    Advisory Committee    No record was found by the s\ irveyor as to the exact origin of the Advisory    Committee. It is not hard to imagine, however, that the group was included in the    By- Laws of the Board of Trustees in gratitude and appreciation of the work done in    the 1945 tax campaign. In laying the foundation for an expanded library program it    is also conceivable that the Board at that time desired these "" ten persons from    various parts of the county"" to "" attend Board meetings, offer suggestions, enter    freely into the discussion, etc."" in order to benefit from the ideas and suggestions    of Committee members.    As the surveyor, studied the actual working out of the combined Board- Advisory    Committee it appeared that the functions of the Committee could be reshaped into    much more meaningful activity today.

Both the North Carolina    State Library and the American Library Association can provide further information    on the varied activities of such a county- wide FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY organization.    Local Library Committees - Duties and Responsibilities    The duties and responsibilities of the local library committee can well be    summed up in the title "" liaison group.""

The    group is responsible for proper housing of the local library and the care and repair    of the property.

The local library committee prepares a budget for the use of the town govern­ment    showing anticipated expenditures in keeping up the library property or making    necessary improvements.    Local library committees are unofficial groups not required by North Carolina    library law. Nevertheless, as long as such committees continue, members need to be    appointed by the governing body for definite terms, just as is the Board of Library    Trustees of the county. This makes for better administration and a more businesslike    system, even though "" business"" may be minimal.    Eight local library committees exist at present yet the Leaksville- Spray area    has no citizen representation.

Books and Library Materials    The lack of sufficient books and library materials was one of the chief com­plaints    heard during the survey. As was pointed out previously, the County Library    is grievously low in books. Due to rising costs the number of books added annually    has also been shrinking. The difference can be seen as follows:    1947- 48 1956- 57    Total spent for books $ 7,137 $ 7,400    Number of books bought 5,330 3,494    Average cost per book $ 1.26 $ 2.10    Population to be served 57,898 67,000    The same rise in cost is also true of book binding, yet books must be rebound if the    public's investment in library materials is to be preserved.    The plain fact has apparently not been faced that the 3- cent tax rate of 1945    will not buy the same amount of books in 1958. Yet demands continue to increase as    population grows. Citizens have a right to complain if their library does not furnish    what is its chief stock in trade. On the other hand, they dare not complain unless    they are also willing to support the plea for more funds.    In addition to the lack of funds, the practice of "" anchoring"" books in the    various community libraries has worked a distinct hardship on the entire county.    a. Only standard reference works and some classics such as the Bible should    be "" anchored"" in any community library.    b. Assigning books permanently to a specific library reduces the number of    titles that can be bought with the amount of money available since more    copies of the same book must be bought.    c. Borrowers are deprived of the joyful experience of being exposed to a    wide variety of books that are constantly changing.

Permanent assignment of books ultimately leads to overcrowded shelves in    the community library. Shelf space is expensive so "" anchoring"" eventually    becomes a financial burden to the local community.    e. Books donated to a specific community library as memorials or gifts are,    of course, assigned permanently to that library.    Book selection to be done successfully must be done cooperatively. It must also    be done systematically, not hit or miss. To inform the public as to how and why    books and other library materials are bought, the Rockingham County Library Board    of Trustees needs to adopt a book selection policy statement now available in many    libraries.    So that all community librarians may become thoroughly familiar with books and    other library materials now being published and make their selections cooperatively,    monthly book selection meetings need to be instituted forthwith. These selections    include not only books but the selection of magazines for each branch, reviewing of    films, and further acquaintance with other library materials, reference works,    pamphlets, documents and the like. At the time of the meeting decisions can be    reached on how the various copies of the new books will be routed through the county.    This will insure an equal distribution of new materials to all areas. No matter how    difficult such a program may seem in achieving, cooperative book selection meetings    will be worth all the time and effort involved.    The surveyor wishes to commend the county librarian for making use of the book    rental service now available to county libraries on a commercial basis.

A bookmobile stop might serve the purpose.    One deterrent to good bookmobile use was the fact that no definite time schedule    had been worked out, probably due to lack of or frequently changing personnel. The    recent series of articles on bookmobile service which appeared in the ALA Bulletin    ( 1957) should help to bring bookmobile service up to modern standards in Rockingham    County. This service might well include special hours for mill workers, stops at    factories at special times and other features.    The care and maintenance of the two bookmobiles seemed rather haphazard and    lacked the regular inspection that county- owned machinery and equipment ought to    have by county maintenance men. Bookmobiles need the same care and inspection that    any piece of road machinery gets. It should not be necessary for county library    staff members to drive long distances for servicing only to spend yet more time    waiting to be taken care of.    In the interest of adaptability and uniformity, the small bookmobile should    some day be replaced by another to match the larger one. This will permit inter-changeability    and be more efficient.    Considering that Alabama, Mississippi and other states with a heavy Negro    population in rural areas no longer operate separate bookmobiles for whites and    Negroes, but serve both races at different stops from the same vehicle to save time,    travel money and staff, it would seem wise to consider the same possibility for    Rockingham County. At present the Negro library supervisor needs time to meet with    organized groups throughout the county, time to promote library sponsored programs,    hold program planning clinics to show and publicize the resources of the library,    time to do film programs and demonstrations with groups. Using the two bookmobiles    together and laying out bookmobile routes to prevent duplicate "" runs"" will eventually    provide'much more efficient service to all the people of the county.",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2013-05-08,2013-05-08,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1527,1527,1525.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1525.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today with over 12,000 books pouring off the presses every year, library per­sonnel    needs to be more knowledgeable than ever. No library can hope to meet the    needs of the specialist continually - or even the ordinary reader at times. Through    high quality personnel it must be able to help the specialist to find the material    needed. This is especially true in the larger population centers of the county such    as Reidsville and the Tri- Cities. Books and materials are important but even more    so are the people who administer them.    The new Public Library Service; a Guide to Svaluation with Minimum Standards    ( A. L. A. 1956) has much to say about the importance of having enough and the right    kinds of people to administer public libraries' services. Describing the requirements    qualitatively first of all the Plan for Better Public Library Service, a condensation    of Public Library Service, has this to say: "" To attract people with the special    qualifications basic to good library work, the salaries your community pays them must    be high enough. And in order to hold and reward superior personnel, a substantial    range of salary increases and promotion should be part of the library personnel    program.

( p. 12)    The above are standards to be achieved in time, of course, but should provide    some guidance in developing future personnel plans.

Libraries in North Carolina have the advantage of getting state assistance of    $ 1,200 per year for two years for each additional trained librarian added to the    staff.    Personnel being the heart of library service, it is indeed commendable that the    Board of County Commissioners passed a motion in the summer of 1957 to begin paying    all County Library personnel out of county funds. This reversed past procedure    where the municipality paid the personnel and the County Library supplemented the    salary. The motion could not be put into effect in 1957- 58 because these salary    funds had not been budgeted, but the precedent has been laid down and should now    guide the Board of Library Trustees in planning the 1958- 59 budget.    The new procedure will accomplish a number of things, chief of them being that    personnel in community libraries will no longer have to serve two masters. They    know that they are directly responsible to the county library administrator from now    on. Apparently this has been quite a problem in some cases, for as one employee    expressed herself to the surveyor: "" I'm so glad I finally know who is my boss now.    It will be a pleasure to work with Miss Johnston.""

Its full effect will begin to be    noticed in 1958- 59.    By this decision the Board eliminated one of the underlying sources cf irritation    that has plagued the Rockingham County Library.

Simpli­fying    the entire budget procedure for the County Library will also simplify the    County Library's fiscal report to the State and make the report clear and intelligible    with no possible overlapping in combining reports from community libraries with those    of the County Library.    A further streamlining of fiscal procedure for the County Library can be ac­complished    by having the County Auditor's office handle all County Library vouchers    and payment of bills. This is generally customary in progressive county library    administration.

North Carolina library law makes it mandatory that the Board of Library Trustees    elect one of its members secretary- treasurer. It also requires that the treasurer    give bond for the faithful discharge of duties. This does not necessarily mean that    the treasurer must actually handle the funds. Modern library administration finds it    more economical and businesslike to have all County Library claims approved by the    Board and then sent direct to the County Auditor's office for payment.    According to information given the surveyor, the funds of the Rockingham County    Library are deposited in a separate bank account in the name of the library and are    not left in the county treasury as required by law. Now the secretary- treasurer signs    checks personally, bills in hand, and a special audit is necessary which costs the    poverty- stricken County Library money it can ill afford.    Regardless of the historical reason that once existed for this unusual procedure    in handling County Library funds, the extra work and cost involved now dictates an    exact adherance to the library law of the state. The following sentence found in the    section of Powers and duties of trustees is very clear: "" But all money received for    such library shall be paid into the ... county treasury, be credited to the library    fund, be kept separate from other moneys, and be paid out to the secretary- treasurer    upon the authenticated requisition of the board of trustees through its proper    officers."" Following the letter of the law would save time and work for library    officials, unify fiscal procedures with other county offices and save the cost of the    annual independent audit.    Fines are not handled uniformly at present. They vary in amount charged and in    final disposition. As mentioned previously— though small in amount, fines are still    "" public funds"" and are collected from patrons for the use of library property. Very    often fines are used in lieu of "" petty cash"" for the purchase of small items.

For    businesslike handling fines must be turned in to the County Library at the close of    each month together with the record of circulation, The County Library will then    reimburse the local librarian from its revolving fund for any small expenditures made    during the month and reported in detail.    The library's extremely rigid budget gave the surveyor considerable concern as    it must concern Trustees and the administrator. The budget for 1957- 58 shows only    $ 500 unassigned out of a total of $ 51,500: $ 100 unassigned for salaries, $ 200    unassigned for operating expenses and $ 200 for miscellaneous building needs. This    unassigned salary sum permits practically no leexvay to pay for any in- service training.    Such rigid budgeting does not allow the library to take advantage of "" special buys""    that may present themselves during the year, allows little leeway for progressive    programs to be tried out. It is understood, of course, that any major problem such    as a bookmobile accident, sudden building emergencies, or prolonged staff illness    would require an emergency appropriation from county government in any case since    these cannot and should not be budgeted for by a single county department.    The reorganization of the County Library's administration with closer county    government relationship will also have a welcome effect on the work of local library    committee treasurers, reducing or even eliminating their responsibilities. When the    surveyor discussed this possibility with local treasurers in the county, the response    was as anticipated - one of relief. Those willing to shoulder community responsibi­lities    are usually few in number and generally overburdened. Library committee    treasurers are no exception.    The table on page 14 showed that all the towns with the exception of Leaksville    and Draper are responsible for the care and maintenance of their local libraries and    two ( Madison and Reidsville) provide some funds for their McRae libraries. Leaksville    will again become responsible for building maintenance for white and Negro libraries    as soon as county government moves the County Library into more efficient quarters and",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2013-05-08,2013-05-08,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1534,1534,1532.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1532.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This pattern of community maintenance of quarters has been generally accepted    throughout North Carolina and the South in general and should be continued in    Rockingham County. Municipalities thus remain completely responsible for the upkeep    of buildings and grounds, for light, heat, water, building maintenance supplies and    janitor service. Also for any permanent equipment such as furniture. Until the    County Library has achieved a higher level of personnel as outlined above and owns a    vastly improved stock of books and other library materials, supplying furniture and    equipment such as desks, tables, chairs, catalog cases and the like needs to remain    the responsibility of local government.    To unify this community responsibility for the maintenance of library housing    it will be necessary for Leaksville, Madison and Reidsville to shoulder the responsi­bilities    for maintaining both the white and Negro branches. Madison and Reidsville    contribute some funds to their McRae libraries now, so the shift will be a normal    development.    With county government paying all library salaries and furnishing all books and    materials and municipal government being responsible for library quarters, local    library committees should be relieved of the handling of actual funds. They should    be required to submit an annual budget to local government officials, showing the    amounts that will be needed for the care and maintenance of the library building - or    the building of new quarters as in Draper - for utilities, furniture, equipment,    janitorial supplies and janitor services. All expenses incurred must be approved by    the library committee as heretofore, but library bills would be paid in the same way    as other municipal bills are paid. This will eliminate all direct financial trans­actions    by the local library committee treasurer, except the spending of gift funds.

As has been pointed out repeatedly in the foregoing pages, the financial    pattern of 1945 set a precedent for public support of the County Library but is no    longer adequate in 1958. It was not even adequate in 1945 considering the salaries    paid Miss Martin and the staff. So there is no sound, long- term value in suggesting    a step- by- step rise in library support from three to four and then later to the    allowable five- cent tax. The Rockingham County Library has been "" a very sick patient""    and in 1956- 57 came close to disintegrating several times. Nothing short of the "" high    protein diet"" of a 5- cent tax will enable it to meet the challenge it faces today.    The library has been fighting for its life too long.    It is recommended that    1. The 1958- 59 budget of the Rockingham County Library put into full    operation the County Commissioners' 1957 resolution to pay the    salaries of all local and county library employees.    2.

This in turn is to    support, uphold and sustain all local library units as well as bookmobile service    throughout the county.    In the years to come it is entirely conceivable that the people of Rockingham    County will some day vote the full, permissible 10- cent tax levy for library support.    Other counties have done so, Rockingham County may. Indeed, such really adequate    support would be an excellent objective toward which the FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY group    could work eventually.    Public Relations and Publicity    As related on page 15, County Library public relations efforts over many years    brought forth good fruit during the trying 1956- 57 period. To urge a Board of Library    Trustees and a county library staff as public relations conscious as those in    Rockingham County to be constantly aware of and continue good public relations is    entirely superfluous. All want to continue to accomplish more and better service.    To this end Miss Johnston and staff were thinking in terms of Program Planners    Clinics, greater use of press, radio and other means of publicity through planned    ( not hit or miss) articles, radio series programs and the like. With Miss Johnston's    training and experience in adult group work considerable headway should be made.    The often disturbing library publicity of the past two years can now begin to    be counteracted by constructive, action- encouraging publicity. One such publicity    phase would be to marshall support for County Commissioners in providing a 5- cent tax.    Money spent on the present survey will be doubly well invested if a group of    citizens - a committee of the county- wide FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY - will publicize    pertinent recommendations so that citizens may be well- informed.

The day when a library could "" go it alone"" and supply its borrowers with a quantity    and quality of service that is called for today - at reasonable cost - is gone.    Instead of the "" independent library"" today's discussion centers around the "" inter­dependent    library"" and a "" system of libraries"" in which each contributes its strength    to the whole and in turn likewise draws its strength from the whole.

Neighbors have knocked at Rockingham County's library door before. In 1942 a    staff member, Miss Elaine von Oesen, also worked in Caswell County part time. In    July, 1949, Miss Gladys Johnson "" urged Rockingham County to help Stokes County.""    Rockingham County was to furnish trained supervision 20 hours per week for $ 1,500    plus travel expenses. Unfortunately "" changes in the Leaksville building and changes    in staff prevented"" the Rockingham County Library from undertaking such cooperative    activity. As far as the record shows, this was the last definite overture presented    to Rockingham County, though the problem of cooperation with other counties persisted.    The survey cannot close without calling attention to some highly pertinent    matters for future consideration. These should concern Rockingham County citizens,    the Board of Library Trustees and government officials even while they are still    working on putting the survey recommendations into effect.    1. In addition to the State Aid available for the hiring of more professional    librarians as previously discussed, the North Carolina State Library Board offers    some book funds to libraries participating in a cooperative book buying specialization    program. ( Example: One library agrees to buy all books published on palomino horses    and agrees to make them available to other libraries through inter- library loan, while    it in turn takes advantage of all the books bought by other libraries, also through    inter- library loan.)    At present the Rockingham County Library does not have the space to house such a    collection which means that each year Rockingham County is losing book funds, however,    small, that it could desperately use.    2, More and more North Carolina libraries are also benefiting from Library    Services Act funds made available by Congress in 1956.

A stronger plan can be    submitted from the outline of development adopted by the Trustees from the recommen­dations    of the survey.    However, "" some priority will be given to plans involving the improvement and    extension of service through cooperative activity by several libraries,"" according    to the Guide for Submitting Plans for the Further Extension of Rural Library Services.    If those "" several libraries"" can be found in surrounding counties, then Rockingham    County will inevitably benefit from such cooperation also for cooperation is never    a one- way street. What helps and benefits library service in other counties will    also increase service to the citizens of Rockingham County.    It is recommended that    These two sources of aid from the state should not be overlooked in planning    for future development and State Library plans should be studied to discover    how and where Rockingham County fits into the picture of state- wide service.    Summary^ and Conclusion    Some day the second twenty- five year history of the Rockingham County Library    ( 1955- 1980) is sure to be written. It may well be that great credit will then be    accorded the small group of Reidsville citizens who were eager to improve the services    of the Reidsville branch of the Rockingham County Library in 1956- 57. What were they    asking? What lacks had they discovered? What problems were troubling them? They    listed such items as:    Almost no professional services,    A book stock of only a fraction per capita,    Vastly inadequate reference books,    A lack of basic classics,    An unsatisfactory and slow stream of new books,    Almost no library leadership in Reidsville,    Mishandling of reference questions,    A lack of administrative supervision from Headquarters 14 miles    away,",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2013-05-08,2013-05-08,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1543,1543,1541.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1541.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"" Getting by""    is certainly one villain.    No less villainous has been the Ostrich Policy. There have been those who have    pointed out that the County Library's income increased from $ 22,103.75 in 1944- 45 to    $ 48,896.27 in 1954- 55 and up to $ 49,025.13 in 1956- 57. What more could any library    ask for? They fail to mention that the County Library's basic income has not changed    and still remains the 3- cent tax levied under the 1945 vote. The only reason the    library has had any increase is due to the fact that assessed valuation has risen    steadily since 1945.    Any pegged levy set at a certain point in a certain year always faces the problem    of changes in the value of the dollar. The human, comfortable Ostrich Policy has    found it more convenient to accept what was won so magnificently in 1945 than to    continue to work toward a more realistic base. In making these statements no fingers    are pointed, no accusations intended. The fact remains that as far as the surveyor    could discover no truly adequate budget for the development of county- wide library    service has so far been prepared. In public administration terms, a public budget    is "" a statement of need."" Such a "" statement of need"" shows what must eventually be    faced if truly adequate public library service is to be given.    The villain "" We and They,"" found in practically every situation in life, is also    present in the Rockingham County Library problem.

The group was composed of the Mayor, rep­resentatives    from the 1ST. C. Library Commis­sion    and the Department of Public Instruction    as well as leaders from various professions and    clubs.    After a lengthy discussion about the proposed    library, the Mayor said that it would be desira­ble    for the ISTegroes to raise money toward the    establishment of the library and that the city    commissioners would appropriate $ 2,500. With    this encouragement, the campaign was organ­ized    with "" A dollar and a book"" as its slogan.    Four committees were formed, namely: finance,    publicity, book and location. These committees    functioned well. The proposed library had ex­cellent    publicity, and a large number of books    were given. The finance committee canvassed    business houses and received many personal con­tributions.    They gave concerts and entertain­ments    to raise funds. The location committee    found its task a difficult one. Various sites were    considered, but after taking all factors under    consideration it was decided that a central, ac­cessible    location on the main Negro thorough­fare    of the city was best.    With the exhibition of such intense interest    the city and county made their appropriations    for a Negro public library without debate, set­ting    aside $ 3,250 for the purpose. This was a    small sum in the city and county budgets, yet    it was large enough to start a library and to pay    a trained librarian. The money raised by the    citizens was used to purchase needed equipment.    The library board was appointed by the    Mayor. It was composed of six citizens who    demonstrated their interest in the library's de­velopment.    They were, named for terms of two,    four and six years.",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1556,1556,1554.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1554.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Harrison Public Library Board:    I hereby submit my annual report for the year ending June 30, 1952.    The activities, materials circulated and programs sponsored by the    Richard B. Harrison Public Library system for this year have been varied.    Thousands of adults and children withdrew books, pamphlets, magazines, film    strips, music records, record players, film projector and pictures. Also    available to the borrowers were reference services and opportunities to    participate in numerous programs. All of this has given our readers ed­ucational,    recreational and occupational benefit.    One of the ambitions of any progressive public library is to extend its    services to the far corners of the city and county. Our branch libraries    have not only made library facilities easily accessible to the people, but    are providing bocks and services v; hich will meet the varied interests of the    people in their respective communities. The fact that both branches are    located in housing projects offers them a splendid opportunity to become    T    an important agency in the civic organizations of the projects. hroughout    the year, organizations such as the Voter's League, Women's and Men's Clubs,    N. A. A, C. P. Clinics, Project Governments, etc. have held meetings in the    branches. Friends of the Library Clubs have been formed to stimulate in­terest    in the use of the libraries.    Another extension agency of which the library can boast as doing an im­portant    service is the bookmobile. It serves 3U stations and makes on the    average of 104 stops throughout Wake County. It makes 2 hour weekly stops on    Tarboro and Oberlin Roads, aroas in the city which arc without branch li­braries.    The bookmobile carries books and magazines to the permanently or    temporarily physically handicapped people of the city and county.

For the first time, this year 4 Adult Education classes were estab­lished    in the county. The bookmobile librarian gave her time to teach    adults who were without a formal education, the 3 "" R's"", good citizenship,    the importance of wholesome family relationship and essentials of health    education. The requests for additional classes were many. Because it was    physically impossible for the librarian to teach them, and the budget    would not permit the employment of a person for this work, the project    has been unable to expand,    The library serves the patients at St. Agnes Hospital once a week with    bedside service. The collection is composed of suitable, large type, eas­ily    handled books which are mostly the small pocket- berk editions. Picture    magazines are popular with the patients. The children's ward is also sup­plied    with books and music recordings.    Public libraries today are more and more becoming community centers.    The staff at the Richard B, Harrison Public Library system combined their    ideas to use all available materials and techniques to make the library a    center of service. The following are some of the activities which the    library sponsors:    FOR ADULTS    Film forums, discussion groups, book reviews, lectures, art exhibits,    music appreciation hours and parties for the blind. Organizations are    invited to hold their meetings in the library.    One of the most important projects sponsored by the library this year    was the American Heritage Discussion Group. Not only did the participants    profit greatly by these discussions, but the library gained much in the    favorable publicity which it received because of it.",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1565,1565,1563.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1563.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increase in the book and periodical budgets has meant that the    library is gradually meeting the needs of its readers. The size of the    musical records collection has increased about 8055.

Obie Harmon, National Petroleum Council and Miami Miramas Hotel,    In conclusion, I should like to look into the future, and indicate    some of the plans which the library has for furthering its service.    First, expanding the county library service by purchasing a book­mobile    which is large enough for the borrowers to walk in, and has a    book capacity which is much larger than our present bookmobile. Services    to the rural people will be greatly enhanced should such a vehicle be at    their disposal.    Second, with the numerous programs which attract large crowds to the    library, an auditorium is necessary. A large, undeveloped space in the    building could well be utilized for this purpose. It could also be used    for art exhibits and additional stack space.    Third, bringing salaries and book budgets up to at least the minimum    standards of the American Library Association.

AMERICAN HERITAGE DISCUSSION PROGRAM    The - American Library Association received a grant from the Fund for    Adult Education of the Ford Foundation to set up discussion groups on Am­erican    Heritage in six regional library centers of the United States. The    Richard B, Harrison Public Library was the only library in this state to    take part in this program. The primary objectives of the American Heritage    Project have been helping people to become better informed, becoming aware    of their responsibilities as citizens in a democracy, and a willingness to    take responsibility in applying their own thinking to making their commun­ities    better. Mrs. Etblynne Thomas and the Rev. George A, Fisher were train­ed    in Birmingham, Ala. for leadership of this group. Meetings wore held    twice monthly and included 30 members of which 17 have had only elementary    schooling, 5 have graduated from college and 15 have done graduate work. The    occupations of the participants include realtor, insurance man, teacher, min­ister,    barber, dentist, postal clerk, houseworker, student, janitor, housewife,    contractor, bacteriologist, bookkeeper, and lawyer.

ACTIVITIES    In November, during Book Week, approximately forty- five Wake County    principals, supervisors, and teachers accepted the invitation of the library    staff to be their guests at an informal party. The main feature of the even­ing    was a lecture by Dr. Nell Hirschberg, bacteriologist at the State Health    Department.

S    To further its services as an educational institution, the library at    tho request of the county people, organized four Adult Education '-' lasses dur­ing    the past year. These groups were organized at Green Level, Jeffries    Grove, Juniper Level, and Wendell, North Carolina. The first three groups,    Green Level, Jeffries Grove, and Juniper Level were primarily interested in    the fundamentals: reading, writing, and arithmeticj while the Wendell group    was most interested in family life and community problems. Eighty- seven    persons were enrolled in the four groups. Meetings were held twice each    month in the churches and schools for a period of two hours each.    The task of teaching the adult was not left to the library alone. Leader;,    in other fields such as: home demonstration agents, directors of religious edi    cation, teachers, and ministers were called upon to help in making this progrc    a success. The Family Life Group had as their speakers at various times auth&lt;    itics in tho social science fields, and ministers from local churches who were    able to discuss with them the emotional needs of children and how to make the?    community a better place in which to live.

FRIENDS FROM OTHER LANDS    During the year, Miss Maye Harper, Red Cross worker in Japan, sent the    library many hand- painted dolls from Japan. These are hand- carved from wood,    She also sent a beautiful lamp with a wooden base carved in the shape of a    doll. The shade is hand- painted with Japanese designs. This collection,    with its vivid colors, adds much to the children's room. Another contribution    from Miss Harper is a collection of four wind- up toy animals with real life    movements. The children just love them.

They were invited to "" dig for treasures in books"". It was explained    that an enual number of fiction and non- fiction were to be read, and that    all books about pirates would be found in a special place in the library.    A colorful poster was left in each school. A chest was also left in each    school library. Certificates were to be awarded to all children reading    10 or more books. Little black chests were made from construction paper,    and each child decorated his own with gold paper. These were kept in the    library. For each book read, he received a gold coin to put in his chest.    When 10 books were read, the child received a pirate to color. These were    displayed in the library. Booklets were given each member to record the    books read and on which he had reported. The children came into the li­brary    each Tuesday during the Reading ' Club period for special features.    Movies were shown, stories were told and recordings were played during    this time. The Dairy Council provided a movie and milk to all present    on one Tuesday during Dairy Month. More than 50 children and a few mothers    were present at this event.    At the termination of the Vacation Reading Club, the children were    given a party. Those who live in the county and are served by the book­mobile    came in large numbers. Approximately 90 persons, including a num­ber    of mothers, were present. 200 children registered for the Reading Club,    and it was necessary to draft the whole staff of the library to help make    it a success.

HEADING INTERESTS    Suprising as it may seem, the boys are very interested in cookbooks.    Baseball books have also become a favorite among them, as well as the girls.    This is due to the increased number of Negro baseball players in the major    leagues. The teen- agers are very interested in love stories suitable for    their age group. Books on manners have also become very popular,    AIMS    The reading interest is high among the children, and it is our aim to    continue to provide them with wholesome material on which they can grow.    Many new clubs, such as the Hobby Club, Handicraft and Book Club, are being    organized for boys and girls.    Plans are being made for sending "" Baby Letters"" ( pink for girls and    blue for boys) to all new- born babies, expressing our joy at their arriving    safely with the hope that they will be future readers of the library.

With    this in mind, the Richard B. Harrison Public Library has,    for many years, sought to take to the sick, through hospital service, the    companionship and understanding of books. In many instances, interest in    reading has been awakened for the first time in patients whose lives have    have been so full of home and family duties that they have denied themselves    the gratification which may be derived from reading. Consequently, they    have been happy to learn, for the first time, of public library facilities    available to* them, and have become constant and regular readers at the    library.    COMMUNITY COOPERATION    As an experiment in public relations, and with the idea of motivating    interest of the community by co- ordinated activation in view, a project    was begun, with the juvenile patients„ A woman, who was active in civic    affairs', agreed to make weekly visits to the children's ward to read and    tell suitable stories, Although at times there were only two or three    ( on one occasion, just one) old enough to appreciate the stories, this    period proved to be a favorite hour with the children. The ultimate aim    of this effort was to interest other women to the point of organizing a    Mothers' Club which would have any number of possibilities toward con­structive    work for young patient3, Ur. fortuhately, this wa: i not accom­plished    this yerr, but plans and surveys are being studied toward this",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1583,1583,1581.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1581.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECORDINGS    Another service to the children at the hospital during the year was    supplying records for the children's ward, A record p3ayer had been do­nated    for this ward, but only one record was included with the gift, A    selection of records was carried there by the hospital librarian each    week on her regular scheduled visits.    READING INTERESTS    To the average adult patient, books have been a source of cheer and    comfort rather than a channel through whih^'& podific iAformaticd could be •    obtained. This is why the hospital collection consists of such a small    percentage of specialized subjects. Very rarely is there a request for    factual materials. We do, however, include a few of these for those who    may desire them. The trend with reference to the choice of reading which    has prevailed since the service began still holds true. Light fiction    and easy religious literature are by far the most widely r'f\ ad. Many pop­ular    titles are now available in the pocket size, and these are used to    a great advantage due to the fact th-° t they are more easily, handled by the    patients. They also reduce the library's book loss. Of course, there are    unending requests for TRUE STORY MAGAZINE and comics ( they are. referred to    as funny book. 3) which can very seldom be supplied because they are not in­cluded    in our collection. Occasional gifts of this sort are our only means    of supply.    Pictured magazines constituted a large percentage of the circulation,    particularly Negro periodicals.

The lively and mirthful - spirit of the"" maternity patients would be    sufficient compensation for'the- hospital service.

We still seek the solution of this    problem.    CIRCULATION    St. AgneS Hospital has approximately 100 beds, including beds for    children, and the circulation during the year was 1,596, which is a slight,    decrease of the previous year. Any of several factors could have been    responsible for this, such as varying degrees of the patients' illness, or    the difference in the reading capability of the patients during specific    periods, etc. But the value of the service cannot and must not be measured    by the number of books, etc., circulated. What really counts is the good    affected as the result of the service. On the whole, it has been reported    by those in charge of the patients that the service has created a better    feeling of good will to fellow patients and nurses; there are fewer calls    for nurses when the patients' minds are occupied with interesting reading    matter, and has caused a more quiet and peaceful atmosphere in the hospital    wards.    LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE    Although service is given only once a week, it is evident that more    frequent visits would facilitate more adequate service. This has been in­dicated    through reports by many patients that their reading supply is ex-hausted    long before the next scheduled visit. It is hoped that in the fu­ture    more time can be given to imorove this situation.    It is also desirous that a specialized program for children be inaug­urated,    and special attention will be given to this phase of the program.",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1586,1586,1584.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1584.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The    Chavis Heights Branch of the Richard B. Har­rison    Public Library has its own collection    of books drawn from the main library to fit the needs and interests of this    community, ^ hile the branch library concentrates chiefly on books and other    printed material, it includes other materials, such as recordings, pictures    pamphlets, and newspaper articles. It tries to use every possible means to    give service to this community, so that people will think of the branch li­brary    as a source of help.    The Chavis Heights Branch Library is located nearly in the center of the    project which houses 231 families. Since most of these people are domestics    and laborers, their interests vary, and their reading is somewhat limited.    They enjoy reading books that are short, light and full of excitement. Ma­gazines,    short stories and pictures are widely circulated.    SERVING THE COMMUNITY    The Branch serves as a meeting place for such groups as Garden Clubs, Boy    Scouts, church and civic organizations. Each Monday, the ^ ell Baby clinic,    sponsored by the Wake County Health Department, is held in the library. Dur­ing    the month of June, the vaccination clinic was held. An unlimited number    of adults and children took advantage of this opportunity to be inoculated    against diphtheria and typhoid fever.

BOOK WEEK    Each year, libraries throughout the country observe Book Week. We    joined them this year with the national theme, "" New Horizons with Books"",    Our aim was to get books into the hands of the adults. This was done by    placing colorf* 1! posters and attractive books throughout the library. As    children would visit the library, a book was sent to their parents. In    this way, many adults became constant visitors and readers.    STORY HOUR    This program remains one of the library's best drawing cards for chil­dren    of all ages and some adults. They enjoy participating in singing of    songs, playing quiet games and listening to stories. Special features of    the story hour have been movies and recordings.

As an added attraction for    this occasion, a colorful bulletin board covered with jackets of new and in-i    teresting books was displayed at the library. Many people used the library    during this week. As a climax to the Book Week program, Mrs. Phyllis Queen    gave a book review.    In December, a Christmas party was given the children at the library.    Seventy- five children attended this event. Christmas carols were sung, and    the story of Christmas was told by the librarian. Afterwards, each child    was given a Christmas stocking.    The branch celebrated the annual Doll Party at the main library. Large,    small, pretty, ugly and unique dolls were carefully judged by 3 women judges.    Prizes were awarded to the winners. A movie was shown the children as a    special feature.    Thirty- five children were registered in the Vacation Reading Club.

COMMUNITY CO- OPERATION _    The Washington Terrace Library Club was organized in February, 1951.    Many meetings, both business and social, wore held. Twenty- five members    attended these meetings regularly. The club has sponsored various pro­grams    for the library. , Two floats, which were decorated by members of the    club, participated in the High School and Shaw University Home- coming    parades. This was excellent publicity for the library. A barbecue was    also given by the club to raise funds for minor operating expenses,    CONTRIBUTIONS    The Raleigh Chapter of the Delta Sigma Thota Sorority gave fifty    books for children and adults. Others who donated books are Miss Irma    Korman, Mrs. Louise Taylor and Mrs. Walter Saunders, Mr. A. W. Taylor    gave the library a bulletin board; Mr. Charles Watts donated a pencil    sharpener, a box of pencils and typewriter paper; Raleigh News and Ob­server    furnished the daily paper; Mrs. Dorothy Brunson gave a roll of    cotton plus her services toward re- decorating the furniture in the reading    room, and the Washington Terrace Library ciub donated the material used to    repair the furniture in the reading room, which was formally opened as a    service for the housing project.    AIMS. OR LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE    \ 1. We hope to be able to purchase a record player.    2. Purchase furniture for another room which is now unfurnished.    3.

This library was always alert to change and modern means of serv­ing    its readers and in 1923 established the first bookmobile ser­vice    in the state. That year its librarian became director of    the North Carolina Library Commission and thus extended its in­fluence    beyond the city. The Stanford L. Warren library has also    made a fine record of service to its readers; its services, col­lections,    building and fiscal support are recognized for their    excellence. Both libraries face a future for the development    and growth of a service that can only lead to the improvement of    the individuals who use library services in the county libraries.    It is most fortunate and apropos that Dr. Benjamin E.    Powell, Director of the Duke University Library, a past- president    of the American Library Association and Chairman of the Board of    Trustees of the Durham Public Library should lead in the strength­ening    and growth of public library services in the City and County    of Durham. I value not only his interest in this study, but also    to the many others who are deeply interested in the future of    library service in Durham and for their aid, information and assistance.",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2013-05-08,2013-05-08,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1606,1606,1607.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1607.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regardless of the legal frame - work within which the library    operates, if these two elements are lacking, the library cannot    function effectively and will not fulfill its proper role in the    community it serves."" Mrs. Marbury also emphasized that "" there    is no magic to be found in legal organization."" Clearly, the    two ingredients to success' must occur simultaneously, for the    one without the other will not mean for a successful program.    YJlth these two basic premises to build on, a program    of growth and development for a single library system can be    projected for the Durham libraries. Sufficient funds and strong    leadership can work wonders in the provision of a strong, reason­able    library program. Let us review and consider the various    elements involved in good library service.    The Book Collections    A library without enough books is not a library.

In the two libraries, the Durham Public and the    Stanford L. Warren Library, there are only 139, U. 90 volumes avail­able    to the people using these libraries. This figures out at 1.39    volumes per capita for those using the Stanford L. Warren Library    and at 1.08 per capita for those using the Durham Public Library.    This does not give enough diversity or quantity to meet the needs    of library patrons, for both libraries( contain some materials no    longer needed, some which are obsolescent and some which duplicate    titles in the other library and where the duplication is not neces­sary    or required. The prevention of unnecessary duplication can    mean that either more titles can be added or more duplicates of    highly used books be secured. For the Durham area needs, there    should be in the library system not less than 165,000 - 175* 000    active books. This recommendation is based on five major premises:    1) students who use public libraries, now in increas­ing    numbers, require extensive duplication of mater­ials    as well as access to long files of periodicals,    older book titles and subject material in depth that    cannot be housed in the high school library;    2) county library service requires a larger collection    to work from because of a lower turnover rate of    materials used and because of a wide variety of    materials used and needed to satisfy demands;    3) more books are needed to meet the growing needs of    research specialists and their allied and family needs;",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2013-05-08,2013-05-08,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1611,1611,1612.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1612.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The collections must be kept free of older and obso­lescent    materials that can be obtained from the State Library,    or possibly on a contract basis from either academic institution    in the city. These materials, usually infrequently used should    be borrowed on a fee basis as the unit cost of a book borrowed    from another library must be reckoned less in terms of the borrow­ing    library than in terms of the lending library. Even on a fee    of basis it will be cheaper to pay for the borrowing of a book    from an academic library than it will be to purchase, keep and    service the book In the Durham libraries. Precedent for this    type of financing has already been set by the state of Maryland    which contracts with Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library to    supply little used materials to other public libraries in the    state.    The book budget should ideally be not less than fifty    cents per capita and this would involve an expenditure of approx­imately    # 56,000 annually rather than the # 30,000 now expended.    This annual figure presupposes an adequate book collection to    begin with, a situation which does not now exist. It is further    recommended, therefore, that supplementary annual grants of    $ 25,000 be granted for the next six years to bring the collection    up to an adequacy to permit the annual budget to be solely used",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2013-05-08,2013-05-08,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1612,1612,1613.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1613.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not without coincidence that the city in the    state ( Asheville) with the highest per capita book budget ex­penditure    (\± 6f£) also has the highest per capita circulation    ( 7.6) of books loaned for home reading. People cannot use    materials which the library does not have and an inadequate    book collection will not encourage the use, to the extent de­sired,    of libraries with an inadequate book collection. A sound    investment, therefore, does result in increased use of library    materials.    Many public libraries to- day have developed fine    audio- visual programs, adding both musical and non- musical re­cordings    as well as educational films to their collections.    Whether using linguaphone recordings or documentary files, this    method of extending educational opportunities is most popular    and instructive. If such a program is added, consideration    should be given to the establishment of a cooperative program    with other cities and counties or possibly through the expansion    of the existing system. Special funds should be allocated for    this purpose over and above those needed for the acquisition and    maintenance of the book collection.

The book resources, or collections, are the heart of    a library. Without them in adequate numbers, we cannot provide    the service that is expected of a library.

Reference questions must be answered and    advisory services given when required.    The Staff    The quality of the personnel of the library will be of    even greater importance than the quantity, though it must be    pointed out that without the required number of professional    assistants, not even the best librarians will be able to do an    adequate piece of work. Instead of the five professional    librarians in the two libraries in Durham, there should be not    less than seventeen. This is a basic need in order to cover the    diversity of more, both within and without the library. Included    on the staff should be members who are specialists in selecting    resource materials and in preparing service programs for children,    for young adults and adults, whether that service is given in    county or in the city.

Likewise the administrative staffs of both    libraries will be involved and there is no problem that men of    good will cannot solve. There will be many advantages.

The present    heads of the two libraries should continue their responsibility    for the work that goes on in each main building.

Such agencies would have more limited services    than is ordinarily found in branch libraries. Rather than being    staffed by trained librarians, persons who are college graduates,    who have good book backgrounds and interests, and who have an    ability to get along well with people, would be in charge.    Essentially they will be advisors and counselors as to good read­ing.    The clerical work of charging and discharging of books,    the registration of borrowers, the housekeeping duties of keeping    the library in order, would be the responsibility of the cleri­cal    staff. The book collections would consist of good current    books for all age levels together with the popular classics of    all times. The collections would contain approximately 10,000    volumes and any book which not used actively in the course of a    year would be returned to the main library collection. The re­ference    collections would be kept to a minimum and readers would    be referred to the main library for reference work in depth and    for the use of more specialized materials. There would be week    day afternoon and evening hours, as required, and hours on    Saturdays to meet the needs of those who work.

Indeed, often they will be the catalyst whereby others will con­tribute    to the welfare and growth of the library. This group    can by means of lectures, programs and the like, publicize the    work of the library and give those in charge of the library    support to their endeavors. In addition strong support can    come from many civic and service groups who are keenly interested    in the growth and development of the library. Sometimes they    approach the library, more often the Board or staff must go to    them with their story and request for support.

Cooperation    Because of the current explosion in the intensified    use of libraries every where and in all kinds of libraries, and    because so many library problems can be solved by cooperation,    I further recommend the creations of a Durham Library Council.    The Council's membership would include the administrators of the    separate libraries of the area — college, public school, special    and university, and to this group I would add some trustees and    lay people to directly represent the reader 5 s point of view. This    Council should meet three or four times a year; should have a    stated agenda; should have sub- committees to study problems and    report back to the Council for action; and should have some means    for publicizing the achievements, goals and the problems of the    libraries, both collectively and individually.

Until some such body as    this can study the needs and requirements for total library    service in a community, we will not make the contributions to    society we could make with this type of cooperation. One of    the chief advantages is that by cooperative action, through    savings, the library dollar for each institution should go    much further.    CONCLUSION    This study has been an attempt to bring practical,    conservative recommendations to improve library service in    Durham - county and city - within reasonable fiscal means of    doing so. I believe this can be done at not too great a sacri­fice    by the community. The above goals have already been met    and exceeded by many other communities the size of Durham —    and by some smaller and by many larger. It must be remembered    that the public library is a unique institution -- no other one    community service agency can or does accomplish as much for so    many people.

Ten Years of Significant Progress    Ten years ago, the fall of 1944, the Horton Branch    Library which is now being replaced by the East    Winston Branch Library, opened its doors to the Win­ston-    Salem public on "" an all- day schedule"" with two    full- time staff members. Prior to that time, this    Branch Library which had its beginning in 1927 in    a small room loaned by the Chestnut Street Branch    of the YWCA with three citizens giving voluntary    services, was only opened to the public during the    afternoon hours.    With the idea of making library services available    to as many citizens as possible, increasing the use of    the library by the quality of the program presented,    the two- membered staff pursued varied ways "" to    bring people to the library"" and "" to take the library    to the people"".    The first service in "" taking the library to the peo­ple""    was the attempt to meet "" an expressed need"",    that of giving bed- side service to convalescing pa­tients,    adults and children, at the Kate B. Reynolds    Memorial Hospital. This service was given twice    weekly for seven years. Today it is being given in    cooperation with the Junior Red Cross.    A second "" expressed need"" was met by the Branch    through activities that may be termed as extension    services. One day a week, long before the days of    the Bookmobile, by means of a rented car, "" books    in boxes"" were circulated to residents of the county    both children and adults.    With the coming of the Bookmobile and another    librarian in 1949, library service was given to Recre­ation    Centers, Housing Projects and Kindergartens in    suburban areas along with regularly scheduled in­dividual    service to county residents.

Through this    "" always popular"" department, this Branch introduced    to the community the value of "" audio- visual"" in    public library service. In the beginning, the Branch    was able to give this service because a nearby    friendly church permitted the library to borrow its    audio- visual equipment until it could purchase its    own. This equipment was purchased just in time to    help the public library system qualify as one of the    ten libraries in the state selected to participate in a    state- wide "" film pool"". Today this service is a part    of the "" Film Library"" of the public library system    which operates from the main library.    In an effort to bridge that important gap between    children and adults, a librarian with a sympathetic    understanding of young people was added to the    staff in 1952. In addition to guidance in the selec­tion    of purposeful and leisure time reading, this de­partment    is a clearing house of information through    the media of discussion groups. An account of the    success of this department was published by the    Wilson Bulletin, a professional periodical, in its June,    1952 issue.    Also in 1952, the library added its first clerical    assistant who introduced to the public the popular    "" Newsletter"", the library's first monthly publication.    Requests to be added to its mailing list have been    received from residents throughout the city, state and    nation.    The Branch Library took its first step in Adult Edu­cation    activities when it cooperated with the Ameri­can    Library Association and introduced to the com­munity    the American Heritage Project which is a    group discussion on "" the American Heritage and its    contemporary applications"".

The Superintendent, Professor E. M. Wilson,    because very much interested, acceded gladly    to this request, and gave the librarian splendid    support.    The teachers, after hearing Mrs. Battle's    plan, became quite enthusiastic, and the plan    soon developed from a wonderful possibility to    a working reality, with splendid r y esujts.

After gaining the co- operation and support    of the Principal of the High School, and his    faculty, the librarian worked out a short "" L i b ­rary    Course"" for the instruction of every class    in High School, about 500 students. The High    School students were selected as needing this    course most in their work, and it is the purpose    of Mrs. Battle to teach the freshman class each    years as they are promoted from Grammar    School to High.    The superintendent had 500 copies of this    course made and each student given a copy to    study.    After they had been drilled on these ques­tions    and answers, each class in turn, at an    appointed time, marched from the school build­ing    across town to the public library, for a    practical demonstration.

This secret was the giving to    them the key to the library, thru the card    catalog, which key unlocked the combination to    the great vault or storehouse of treasures that    filled our library shelves, and gave them specific    directions '' How and Where to Find Any In­formation    ' 9 quickly, efficiently and independent­ly,    whether is be essay, poem, quotation or any    branch of knowledge.

The most important feature of knowing how    to use this key was that not only was it a    wonderful help in their high school career, but    that it was of vital importance in their college    work, and of inestimable value on thru life,    wherever they had an opportunity to use a    library, for a working knowledge of one library    meant a working knowledge of all libraries,    since all have adopted the same system of classi­fication    and cataloging.    A well known president of a university said    recently that it had become a well established    fact, that when a student came from a place    where there was an up- to- date and progressive    library, and he had been taught the library key    thru the card catalogue, that he did 50 per cent    better work in his college course.

It has been marvelous to note the change in    the work of the high school students in [ the    library since this course was given. Before,    there would sometimes be as many as 40 or 50    students in the library at the same time, all    patiently, or impatiently, awaiting their turn to    beseech the librarian to please find them a cer­tain    essay or poem by a particular writer, or    something on some particular subject. The usual    cry being that they had to report on same    "" t h e next d a y , "" and therefore were in a frantic    hurry. The poor librarian was almost frantic    herself, trying to find each individual student's    material for them, while the others stood about    or wandered around from shelf to shelf utterly    helpless to know where to look for anything for    themselves. Now, they walk in with a feeling    of pride and independence, in knowing the key.    They look over to the catalog cabinet, and in a    few moments know upon what shelf and in    which section in the library any material desired    can be found.    This knowledge of knowing how to use a    library intelligently and efficiently, has become    such an important part of the educational sys­tem,    that in many colleges today, especially the    normal schools and it'he universities, a library    course is compulsory.

Outside the class­room,    the public library is the one place where the individual    is free to follow his instincts for growth and development to    the ultimate of his capacity.    The Citizens of Raleigh and Wake County must provide these    opportunities for themselves and their children. However, at    the present time, we are failing to meet this responsibility.    Why improvements are needed    As a result of increasing public pressure, an independent pro­fessional    survey team from the American Library Association    was recently employed to report on our county- wide library    program. Their recommendations were completed in October,    1960, and included the following shocking statements:    # "" In comparison with recognized library standards, Raleigh    and Wake County have only one- third of a library . . . .    we know of no other comparable area with such poor library    facilities.""    • "" Raleigh ranks well below Asheville, Charlotte, Durham,    Greensboro and Winston- Salem in every facet of service    ( book stock, circulation, personnel, floor space and oper­ating    funds).""    9 "" In respect to library services, the citizens of Raleigh and    Wake County are now more underprivileged than any    other city in North Carolina and most cities of the United    States.""    Our library program, in sharp contrast to the many other cul­tural    advantages of living in this community, is far below    average standards. The present central library building, do­nated    as a gift to the City in 1899, when Raleigh's population    was 13,600, cannot meet the needs of a City of 100,000 nor    a county- wide population of 169,000.    What you will vote for    The proposal before the voters of Raleigh and Wake County    on June 6 provides for an improved county- wide library system,    including a new main library building and two branches, and    adequate annual operating funds for the improved library    program.    If you are a citizen of Wake County, you will be asked to vote    for a modest tax supplement to provide operating income on    an annual basis for improved library services. The maximum    amount of the supplement will be 7^ per $ 100 property valu­ation    which will produce $ 200,000 annually for library oper­ations.    Raleigh citizens, in addition, will be asked to approve a    $ 850,000 bond issue to provide the new main library for the    county- wide system and two branch libraries in the City.    Branch libraries throughout the county, now operating on the    uncertainties of private donations and limited public funds,    would be financed through the new program. New branches    in municipalities now without library facilities, would be oper­ated    as a part of the new program. Municipalities would pro­vide    suitable facilities and upkeep.    Both the amount of the bond issue and the annual operating    fund are considerably below the recommendations of the pro­fessional    surveyors. But, because of careful advance planning,    library officials believe the recommendations, for the most part,    can be met by a lesser expenditure. This represents a real    bargain to the voters of this Community.    What it will cost    Are we willing to pay for progress in our community? Are we    willing to provide new opportunity for all our citizens? Some­one    must bear the cost for improved library services. Or else    we must continue with our present inadequate program.    The only new tax required to pay for this program will be a    supplement of 74 per $ 100 property valuation on all citizens.    In terms of a homeowner with a $ 15,000 home, his tax in­crease    will be approximately $ 4.20 per year. Is this price —    less than the cost of one new book — too much to pay so that    Raleigh and Wake County citizens can remove themselves from    the "" underprivileged"" of this nation in respect to library    service?

Current expenditures for library service amount to $. 59 per    capita in Raleigh and Wake County, well below all other major    North Carolina cities and the national average of approxi­mately    $ 1.20 per capita.    Per capita circulation of books is 2.43, considerably below the    accepted norm of 7 books per capita per annum.

We wanted them, as always, to read worthwhile    books, and we felt that the idea of a travel club    would take away all feeling that they were doing    school work.    We made block tickets which read: "" This    ticket entitles the bearer ( name inserted in red    capital letters) to one continuous passage to the    points punched below over the Caldwell County    Library Railroad Via the Book Route"". We had    blocks for North America, South America,    Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and Antarctica.    The Club was organized, officers were elected,    and the necessary rules were explained. Members    made their own decisions as to itinerary. Each    had a passport with a picture. All were told    where to go in case of trouble— such as a lost    passport or money troubles. They were told of    money exchange in foreign countries. And they    were required to read two books on each country    and answer, satisfactorily, the questions the    librarian asked about that country. These ques­tions    were carefully compiled and had to be as    carefully answered. Sometimes the questions    were tricky and, unless the traveler had read the    books and absorbed the facts, weak answers    often meant that no travel credit was given.    We mounted maps of the continents on large    pieces of cardboard and listed each country on a    continent underneath the map. Then, when    members had satisfactorily given their answers,    we put a red thumb tack on the map in the    country they visited, and under that country    heading, we put a corresponding red sticker with    the traveler's name. In this way all could see just    who had visited what country or what continent.    And then we punched the tickets!    The plan was originally meant to interest the    children, but we had hardly organized when a    newspaper reporter learned about it. Each week    he wrote an article about our travelers. Soon    adults became interested too. Parents of the    junior members were automatically interested.    I was often told how the children "" popped    some travel question at members of the family,    embarrassing them because of their woeful lack    of knowledge and proudly going into detail on    what proved, when checked, to be an absolutely    correct answer!"" So the grown- ups came too,    organized a club all their own and although they    did not get chart credit, they held very interest­ing    meetings. We had close to six hundred mem­bers    in all, and our circulation for club books    alone passed the two thousand mark.    I was very careful in selecting books to be read    for credit because I had to figure on the varied    ages of the members and select the books accord­ingly.    We employed one corner of the library,    arranging books on the shelves by continents    with small maps at the head of each section. We    used these books, among others: Ruth Bryan    Owens' Denmark Caravan and McVeagh's Greek    Journey; all the foreign series of Madeline    Brandies; Through the Harbor, by Eberle; Tilio,    A Boy of Papua, by Voorhoeve; Out of Africa,    by Dinesen; Jenik and Marenka, by Trinka;    Scout to Explorer, by Siple; Robin and Jean in    France — in England — in Italy, by Lawrence    Williams; Ear Peoples, by Grace Philips; South    Sea Island Playmates, by Robert Eskridge; the    Nancy and Peter travel series, by Mildred Com­fort;    Jean & Company Unlimited, by Helen    Perry Curtis.    Then, because these books were written largely    in fictional form, I felt that some non- fiction    books should also be used. So into this collection    went our newly acquired set of Lands and Peo­ples""    in thirty unit volumes which could be    loaned as we would lend any book not on refer­ence.    The members were required to read these    books and give statistical facts. It was not diffi­cult    to get this important information because    ::- See last page.",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,600 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1661,1661,1662.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1662.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were delighted to see pic­tures    of the Taj Mahal; Rome's great Colosseum;    the "" streets"" of Venice; to see colored pictures of    Chinese temples, to compare in color the differ­ences    in dress between Chinese and Japanese    people; to see an English farmyard in color, the    River Thames and the Nelson Monument in    T r a f a l g a r Square;    to see Westminster    Abbey "" j u s t as    Robin and Jean de­scribed    it in their    book on England"".    Before long even    visitors from out of    town came in to ask    about the project    and be shown the    charts, maps, and    tickets. Occasion­ally    they would hear    a book review or    stay to ask one of    our travelers some    questions and find    themselves amazed    at the information    the members had    acquired from their    arm chair traveling.    Only club mem­bers    were allowed to    attend the regular    Thursday morning    meetings. These    meetings were open, informal affairs with the    children doing most of the talking. Programs on    large cities were given by the members, who used    maps and all available pictures to make the pro­gram    realistic.    At some meetings we would have quizzes, let­ting    the European travelers line up against the    Asia travelers. I would ask questions and, of    course, the side being able to answer the most    questions would win. At one meeting the chil­dren    were asked to decide which country they    liked best in all their travels and were given mate-    Oslo, Norway    Dear Mother and Daddy:    I'm having a grand time up here. I go ice skating every    morning. I enjoy the scenery. They have snow on top of    the mountains all the year round.    1 have seen some old Viking ships. They have some    beautiful old designs on the stern. I went to ride on one    of them yesterday. I went to Oslo, the capital, which has    some beautiful buildings. They have public libraries and    schools, and I saw where the King and Queen live!    I am staying with a woman up here who does a lot of    weaving. Nonvegians arc very famous for their weaving.    This woman sends her weaving to England to be sold. Her    husband is a lumberman. He says Norway makes a lot of    money out of lumber. They have many trees and streams    for the trees to float down. The rivers afford good water    power. I can't express how beautiful the scenery and    customs and many other things arc. I wish yon could be    with me.    Love,    MARY ELIZABETH    rials to write a letter back home describing the    country. They were to tell how many things    they had observed on their visit, in fact, every­thing    of interest. Of course, they were not    allowed even to peek inside a book nor look at    a single map nor ask a question. This letter had    to be an honest account of what they "" saw"".    I was surprised at the letters. They were good!    Those children really learned a great deal about    foreign countries. Some of the best letters were    published and the    children were very    proud. The letter on    this page was writ­ten    by an eleven-year    old member of    the club:    Our school super -    i n t e n d e n t s , our    principals and our    teachers were de­lighted    with the re­sults    of the club.    Classroom teachers    tell me they already    see improvement in    Social Studies work.    The State Library    Commission felt,    too, that it was a    very worth- while    project and that li­brarians    in and out    of the state would be    interested in adopt­ing    this very plan.    The Children's    Department of the    New York Public Library obtained the details of    the program, just how it was conducted and the    nature of the results obtained.    So I cannot but feel that all the extra work    was well worth it. Our circulation was boosted;    we added many new borrowers to our files. We    have the satisfaction of knowing that our bor­rowers    are reading worth while books, and we    have done something toward bringing about a    more amicable feeling between our children and    the children of other countries. Our children    know a great deal about foreign children now!",2008-08,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,600 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1662,1662,1663.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1663.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Q. What is the library referendum all about?    A. It is an opportunity for Fayetteville residents    to vote on a bond issue for the construction of    a new and modern Central Library in downtown    Fayetteville.    2. Q. Why do we need a new Central Library Build­ing?    A. We need a new Central Library Building be­cause    the present library facilities of 29,606    square feet for all buildings are far short of the    standards of 90,000 square feet set for a library    system in a metropolitan area of 180,000. The    population of Cumberland County projected    to 1970 is estimated at 200,000, which, according    to Federal standards, would require 100,000    square feet of space. Even with the new Central    Library, as proposed, we would only have an    area of 57,434 square feet.    3. Q. How much will the new Central Library Build­ing    cost?    A. Estimated cost of the new building, including    demolition, site preparation, construction and    equipment is $ 1,300,000.    4. Q. That's a lot of money! How will it be financed?    A. Capital outlay of $ 1,300,000 would come from    an anticipated Federal Grant of $ 250,000 and    from a $ 1,050,000 bond issue.    5. Q. Does this mean our taxes are going up?    A. Yes. It is estimated that between 6 and 7 cents    per $ 100 evaluation would be added to the pre­sent    tax rate.    6. Q. How much more will this cost the average tax­payer?    A. The average taxpayer with a home worth about    $ 16,000 and an assessed property evaluation of    $ 8,000 would pay less than the cost of one good    magazine a month!",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1671,1671,1672.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1672.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With so many bond issues and increasing taxes,    why can't we put this off for a time?    A. We need a new main library now to fill urgent    needs. There has been no library construction    in Cumberland County for thirteen years, yet    the tremedous population growth has greatly in­creased    the demand for educational centers.    Q. The old post office building has been serving as    a downtown branch library and reference room    for several months. Why tear this building    down? Can't it be converted for library pur­poses?    A. The former post office building is old and out­dated    and not suited to library use, since only    half the total area can be utilized. Remodeling    and repairing is too expensive, about two- thirds    the cost o f a new structure Also, the existing    building is impractical for air- conditioning and    maintenance costs are excessive.    Q. Has this been looked into very carefully and by    responsible people?    A. It certainly has. As a matter of fact, the Cum­berland    County Library Board of Trustees has    been concerned about the lack of facilities for    many years. The Board made its own two- year    study back in 1958- 1959. Then, in 1964, Hoyt R.    Galvin, a nationally recognized library consul­tant    who had been employed by the Trustees,    submitted the findings of his study. Both agreed.    Facilities were inadequate and new facilities    were urgently needed. The Fayetteville City    Council reviewed the Galvin Report, considered    the Library Board's recommendations, and au­thorized    a referendum to decide the issue.    Q. When was it decided to try and obtain the old    post office site?    A. When it was learned in 1961 or 1962 that a new    Federal building containing a new post office    would be built on Green Street. This develop­ment    was known by Mr. Galvin while compiling    his study and he strongly advocated obtaining    the Hay Street site for the new Central Library    Building. A considerable number of local or­ganizations    endorsed the Trustees' efforts to get    the property for this purpose. It was conveyed    at no cost to the citv for library purposes only    in 1966.    Q. Wouldn't it be better and more practical to put    this building in a residential area?    A. Not if the full benefit of the people is consider­ed.    The advantages of a centrally located li­brary    far outweigh outlying sites. Many progres­sive    North Carolina and out- of- state cities de­monstrate    this truth with new centrally located    libraries: Asheville, Greensboro, Charlotte, Ral­eigh,    Gastonia and others; plus Atlanta, Ga.;    Baltimore, Md.; Nashville, Tenn.; New York    City ( Manhattan); Wichita, Kansas; Madison,    Wisconsin and scores of others.",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1672,1672,1673.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1673.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Q. Why not add on to the Anderson Street library?    A. This is not feasible since neither the property    nor the present building will permit the expan­sion    needed. And the location is not desirable    for a Central Library.    13. Q. What are the advantages of a centrally located    library?    A. Location of a library in the center of the down­town    business area is ideal for a number of rea­sons:    ( 1) Provides library services to thousands    of additional people simply by being more con­venient,    more accessible; ( 2) Strengthens the    economy by stimulating trade in the business    district and by helping to attract new industry;    ( 3) Adds prestige and beauty to the downtown    district; to the showcase of our city; ( 4) Pro­vides    an inviting and cultural dimension for the    multiplied thousands of soldiers and to visitors    who frequent the downtown area.    14. Q. How about the parking situation?    A. There will be 30 parking spaces at the Central    Library location itself and more than 1200 park­ing    places within two blocks' walking distance.    15. Q. What will be done with the present library on    Anderson Street?    A. The building and site will be relinquished to the    City of Fayetteville upon completion and oc­cupancy    of the new Central Library.    16. Q. Will we be able to take advantage of any econ­omies    upon releasing the Anderson Street Li­brary?    A. Yes, there will be substantial economies. The    Central Library will consolidate the operation    of the Anderson Street and Hay Street units,    eliminating duplication of certain fixtures,    books, magazines, periodicals and various ma­terials    and supplies. Other maintenance and    operating expenses associated with two separate    locations could be avoided.    17. Q. Would the library service and program be im­proved    wilh the new Central Library?    A. There would be decided improvement. The ad    ditional space and facilities would provide a re­search    area, an audio- visual area and the op­portunities    for development of educational pro­grams    that cannot be offered at the present    time. There would be storage and servicing    areas available for increasing the library's pre­sent    inventory of 90,000 volumes to the recog­nized    standard of nearly 400,000 volumes. Other    services and facilities restricted for lack of    space will be introduced as part of a greatly    improved and accelerated program.",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1673,1673,1674.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1674.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Are our libraries being used?    A. Most definitely. The Cumberland County library    system circulated more than 291,000 books in    1967; and a more convenient location will very    likely double this figure. For proof of the con­venience    factor . . . 400,838 people entered the    new downtown Greensboro library last year.    Traffic had not even approached this figure    prior to the new facility's relocation.    Q. What are some purposes of the modern library?    A. The modern library is a community information    center a source of vital information in our daily    needs. As our headquarters for education, re­ference    information, research and culture, it is    "" The Peoples' University"". It is the after- school    study and entertainment center for children, a    second chance for repentant dropouts, and a    hometown graduate school and adults seeking    broader knowledge.    Q. Will only city residents be permitted to use the    new Central Library?    A. No. The new Central Library will be part of    the county library system and all residents will    be welcome to use the services and facilities.    Q. Who is eligible to vote on the library bond    issue?    A. All registered voters residing in the Fayetteville    city limits.    Q. Why aren't county residents voting on the issue?    A. Residents of Cumberland County provide operat­ing    funds for the library, but not capital funds    for new construction. The county library tax    yields about $ 200,000 a year for operations. It    has been traditional that the City of Fayette­ville    provide capital funds.    Q. Where can more information on the new library    be obtained?    A. Information centers are open 12 hours each day    and are located in the Anderson Street and Hay    Street library buildings.    Q. When do we vote?    A.

The Library provides an opportunity for    every individual to develop his creative and spiritual capacities and to make such    use of his leisure time as will promote personal and social well- being, and to con­tribute    to the growth of knowledge. The objectives of the Cumberland County Public    Library conform to the approved standards as adopted by the American Library Asso­ciation.    Statement of Methods:    The Library seeks to assemble, preserve and administer printed and other educational    materials in organized collections. The Cumberland County Library Board accepts    responsibility to create conditions, legal, financial, social that will implement    the objectives of the Library.

The book collection is organized by the best methods of classification and    cataloging, in order to put materials into the hands of library users as quickly,    and as easily as possible.

If this is true, then it is clear that the greatest investment we can    make in tomorrow is an investment today in the training of men to    meet the responsibilities of citizenship.    If democracy is to continue to work, we must not be satisfied to train    men only for high places in our economy, the professions and govern­ment.    We must bring the sources of knowledge within the reach of    youth in its formative period, and adults who continue their search    for truth and wisdom.    To keep America truly free, we must produce men with moral and    intellectual convictions; men who have the ability to evaluate proper­ly    causes and effects; men of vision who are unafraid. We should be    reminded that: "" A state which develops its men in order that they    may be more docile instruments in its hand, even for beneficial pur­poses,    will find that with small men no really great things can be ac­complished.""

Reynolds has given the    building site. Fifteen corporations and individuals have contributed    approximately $ 800,000 with which to construct the Library building.    Plans are in preparation. As soon as final approval is given by the    Building Committee to construction that conforms with government    regulations, building operations will be started.    The new Library project, which has been advocated for many years,    is, in reality, a $ 1,200,000 program. With the site and building given    by a comparative few, the general public is asked for the modest    minimum of $ 300,000 for the book stock.    Although the present building was financed through a grant from    the Carnegie Foundation made to the town of Winston in 1905, its    only source of financial support has been and still is from the funds    provided annually by the City and later by the City and County.    If the Library project were to be financed through a bond issue, it is    estimated that the cost to the public covering the property, building,    book stock, interest and other items, would have amounted to approxi­mately    $ 2,000,000.    In spite of numerous appeals in behalf of educational and philanthro­pic    agencies, the sources of support for our private institutions have    not dried up. There still is ample incentive to provide necessary library    facilities for our city and county.    The fact that more than 18,000 residents of the city and county used    our present inadequate facilities in 1950, indicates clearly that the    number of people who will use the new Library will increase in direct    ratio to the number of volumes made available for their use.",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1695,1695,1696.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1696.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In    communities of 100,000 or more, 1% books per person should be provided.    Our present book stock numbers 51,966 volumes, or .3 volumes per    capita. This is one of the smallest book stocks in any county in North    Carolina serving a population of 75,000 or more.    $ 300,000, our minimum objective in this campaign, will provide about    100,000 books. This will bring our total to approximately 152,000    volumes. While such a book stock will be somewhat less than the    established standard requirement, it will represent favorable progress    toward our actual need which, according to Library standards, is    260,000 volumes.    It is of further interest to know that from the present book stock,    208,309 withdrawals were recorded for home use in 1950. This in­dicates    that the book stock was turned over approximately four    times. These figures do not include the use of books and periodicals    by visitors to the Library rooms.    On the basis of the above figures and known experience in Libra­ries    comparable to our proposed new institution, circulation, when    the new building and book stock are available, should jump to a    minimum of 600,000 withdrawals. Again, referring to the American    Library Association's standards for communities of this size, our    present number of registered borrowers should increase from 18,000    to approximately 36,000.    The Library has operated a Bookmobile since 1949. Since that time,    circulation has increased in the rural areas from 19% of total to    38%. The total circulation in both the City and County shows a    comparable increase. The Bookmobile serves 45 agencies located in    stores, filling stations, homes, churches and community houses.    All gifts from Negro donors will be used to increase the number    of volumes in the Horton Branch. In addition, a generous allotment    will be provided from the results of this effort.",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1697,1697,1698.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1698.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This period of time will provide three ( 3) tax years in which to    claim Income Tax deductions.    Gifts to the Library Book Fund are deductible on Income Tax re­turns    covering the year or years in which payments are made.    Additional advantages from the tax standpoint will accrue to the    donor who makes his gift in the form of securities. In such case,    neither the donor nor the Library pays any capital gains tax, while    the donor may deduct the full market value of the securities ( re­gardless    of the cost to him) in computing his Income Tax.    We need have no fear that too much money will be raised for this    purpose. While our population has increased materially during the    past twenty- five years, our Library, due largely to the inadequacy    of the building, has remained semi- static.    In planning the book stock, careful attention is being given to a well    balanced selection that will serve the needs of the greater number    of our citizens — both children and adults. Particular attention will    be given to business, technology, home economics, agriculture, animal    husbandry, music and the other arts, and world affairs. Books of    interest to school children of all ages will have prime consideration.    Likewise, the building plans are being carefully analyzed. To this    end the small assembly room, planned to seat approximately 125 peo­ple,    will be ideally appointed for lectures, musicals, visual aid and    like functions. There will be sufficient space for art, sculpture, photog­raphy,    school, and other exhibits. Listening rooms are planned for    people of all ages where they can enjoy the record library to be    provided.    These and other features, will give cause to the people of Winston-    Salem and Forsyth County to be justly proud of their achievement    in behalf of the cultural advancement of the community.",2008-10,"Hancock, Tom",Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1698,1698,1699.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1699.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The group was composed of the Mayor, representatives from    the N. C. Library Commission and the N. C. Department of    Public Instruction as well as leaders from various professions    and clubs.    After a lengthy discussion about the proposed library, Mayor    George 0. Iseley said that it would be desirable for the Ne­groes    to raise money toward the establishment of the library    and that the city commissioners would appropriate $ 2,500.    With this encouragement, the campaign was organized with "" A    dollar and a book"" as its slogan. Four committees were formed,    namely: finance, publicity, book and location. These commit­tees    functioned well. The proposed library had excellent pub­licity,    and a large number of books were given.

They gave concerts and entertainments to raise funds. The location com­mittee    found its task a difficult one. Various sites were considered, but after taking all fac­tors    under consideration it was decided that a central, accessible location on the main Ne­gro    thoroughfare of the city was best .    The city appropriated $ 2,500 and the county $ 750 for a Negro public library without    debate. This was a small sum in the city and county budgets, yet it was large enough to    start a library in a rented store room and to pay a trained librarian. The money raised by    the citizens was used to purchase needed equipment.    November 12, 1935, the Richard B. Harrison Public Library opened its doors to the book-starved    Negroes in Raleigh and Wake County with 890 volumes.    In 1941, this library was one of the initial libraries to receive an appropriation from the    State Aid to Public Libraries Fund. This $ 300 was used to purchase books for rural readers.    Since that time there has been a consistent increase in appropriation which has enabled the    library to purchase more books, establish an interlibrary loan collection of books by and    about the Negro and receive Adult films for circulation.    After ten years, the library felt the need of moving into larger quarters and extending the    services of the library. In November of 1945, a campaign was launched to purchase a build­ing.    As the results of an intensive effort, $ 12,000 was raised toward the purchase of a build­ing.    Considerable renovation was necessary to put it in condition for use. In July, 1948 the    library had its formal opening and was ready to serve its patrons with improved service.

C. Library    Commission for a period of two months. This bookmobile serv­ed    as a demonstration in Wake County to test the need and ap­preciation    for such a service. The results were successful, and    with this in mind, the County Commissioners in 1941, appro­priated    funds for one bookmobile to be used jointly by the    white and Negro libraries. The Harrison library used it 8 days    out of the month and the Raney library 12 days. Soon it was    discovered that in order to meet the growing demands for    library service in the rural areas, two bookmobiles should be    operating. A request for two bookmobiles was granted in 1947.    In 1954, the county commissions appropriated money for two    Gerstenslager bookmobiles. This brightly painted walk- in trav­eling    library owned by the Harrison library covers on the    average of 700 miles per month and 137 stops are made once a    month. It has a shelving capacity of 1600 volumes and dress    patterns, magazines and potted plants are also circulated. The    average circulation per month is 2500.    Special attention is given to the Home and Farm Demonstra­tion    clubs. Where time will permit, story hours are held for    children. Personal contacts between librarian and these rural    readers afford an opportunity to supply essential materials    which will help them to be more useful citizens.

A book truck, loaded    with books and magazines is carried to the bedside of patients    in all wards once a week. This truck is made so that the pat­ients    can easily see the titles of the books and the names of    magazines available. Most of the patients greet the hospital    librarian with such warmth and enthusiasm that it is at once a    real pleasure to serve them and assist them in selecting some­thing    to read which will make their stay there more bearable.    Patients at the Wake County Tuberculosis Sanatorium also    share the library's service. Once a month the bookmobile visits    this institution and leaves books and periodicals for the pat­ients'    use.    Since patients of varied reading ability and interest are found    in the hospital, it is necessary to supply books and magazines    which will satisfy all. As a general rule, religious books appeal    to most of the patients because of the inspiration they receive    from them; however, current pictorial magazines are in great­er    demand than books.    The result of this service has been two- fold. Besides the en­joyment    received from reading while in the hospital, many    patients have been introduced to the main library for the    first time and have become ardent readers. This is most sig­nificant    in evaluating hospital service.

YOUNG ADULTS    In an effort to help young people make a satisfactory adjust­ment    to the world of adults, the library has an obligation to    provide activity and carefully selected reading materials for    this specific group. The Young Adult American Heritage Dis­cussion    group was begun to help carry out this obligation. It    is regarded as a significant part of the library's service to    young people in the age group 17 through 21.    The Teen- Age Library Club was formed to further the interest    of members of this age group in library activities. This club    meets weekly to carry on a program of activities.

The attractive room, pleasant surroundings and    shelves filled with bright colored books serve as an in­ducement    to make the youngsters want to use the library.    Children look forward to the Story Hour which is held    each Saturday morning. The stories they hear fascinate    them to the extent that they want to see the book and    read it themselves. Other features, such as a film, music,    riddles, and quiet games are sometimes included in these    periods.    In the Hobby and Handicraft clubs, one for girls and one    for boys, many useful and unique items are made and    displayed in the "" Hobby Corner.""

The children enter enthusiastically into the summer pro­gram    — Vacation Reading Club, when reading for fun is    emphasized. An interesting theme for the club is always    chosen, and many children are kept reading most of the    summer. A reading certificate is the award given to each    child who reads a certain number of books. These are    presented to them at their respective schools during Book    Week.    The library has a good collection of children's recordings,    also a record player which is equipped with ear phones    so that others are not disturbed while records are being    heard. Listening to records is one of the most popular    pastimes for the children who come to the library, and a    long line forms, as each child waits patiently for his turn    to listen.    Requests from pupils for information on subjects in the    local school work are many; hence the librarian works in    close cooperation with the public schools. Teachers bring    their classes into the library for instruction in its use and    information on units which they are studying.    For inspirational and instructional purposes, famous    authors such as Ellen Tarry, Charlemae Rollins and Peg­gy    Hoffman are presented to the children. Local citizens    who have traveled abroad have been asked to share their    experiences with the young people.

In the case of the  library, the figures in which the staff and the  public are most interested are: circulation, regis­tration,  number of books in collection, number  of books added, and cost of operation.  CIRCULATION OF BOOK AND OTHER  LIBRARY MATERIALS  During the year 1953-54, the Public Li­brary  loaned 229,475 books to the residents  of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County.  Compared with 195,239 over the previous  year, this is an increase of 17%. Within  the past two years, the Library has added  educational film to its collection.

The number counted  for the year 1952-53 was 9,953. Questions  asked range from easily answered ones such  as, ""where may I find a book on the care  and breeding of Parakeets"", to difficult  questions that may require extensive search­ing.  Some sample questions are:  Method of grafting mistletoe on an oak tree.  What year was the ""T"" formation introduced in  football.  List of patent attorneys in North Carolina.  Information about Lillian Gilbreth and her work.  Where and what is the name of the statue of  three monkeys.  THE .NUMBER OF BOOKS ADDED,  and the number withdrawn, and thus the  net increase in book stock is an important  item. The total book stock at the end of  June, 1954 was 65,411 volumes. The li­brary  added 13,789 volumes through gifts  and purchases, and withdrew 2,383 vol­umes  during 1953-54. During the year  1952-53, the library withdrew more vol­umes  than were added, the number being  7,177 against 5,882 added. The unusual  fact of withdrawing more books than were  added resulted from weeding many old,  worn and obselete books prior to moving  to our new quarters. In 1953-54 the li­brary  added 80 rolls of newspapers on  microfilm. In selecting and purchasing  books, it must b.e remembered that we pur­chase  books for three units, the Main Li­brary,  the Horton (East Winston) Branch,  and the Extension Department (the book­mobiles)  and the books for these units are  divided between adult and juvenile. There­fore,  the book funds have to be divided  judiciously in order to cover all of the sub­ject  fields in purchasing children and adult  books. It is well to mention here that the  library has not spent any appropriated  funds for books for the past two years.  All books have been purchased from the  special library book fund which was soli­cited  from the citizens in 1951. The  library has spent about one-half of this  special fund.

REGISTRATION OF BORROWERS  a·nd the issuance of borrower's cards to  library patrons is another means by which  progress is measured. New borrowers in  1953-54 totaled 7,780; of this number, 5,­687  were adults. Juvenile cards were is-sued  to 2,093 borrowers. There are now  20,082 persons holding borrowers cards in  the area served by this lib.rary. We have  no record of the number of people who  use the library who do not register. These  people may be using reference materials,  reading newspapers or magazines or listen­ing  to records.  USE OF'THE LIBRARY MEETING  ROOMS is another facility provided for  tIle citizens of this community. p.uring  the year, 85 groups used the library audi­torium  and the smaller meeting rooms. In  addition to the above, the facilities were  used by groups of libraria·ns on seven oc-caSI•  ons.  THE CHILDRENJS DEPARTMENT  in the main library conducted a total of  117 story hours serving 4,127 children. The  Children's Librarian and the librarians in  the adult department conducted 39 groups  of school children through the library,  representing 1,186 persons.  THE ART GA·LLERY EXHIBITED  ten traveling exhibits during the year, with  art works by the old masters, to works b.y  modern artists and sculptors. These works  were viewed by 7,600 persons.  NEW EAST WINSTON BRA1VCH is  under construction, and is expected to be  ready for occupancy by the early fall of  1954.

At this tim.e the county  commissioners appointed six libTHry trustees and appropriated $3,000  with which to carry out three objectives: namely, to qualify for State  Ajd, to employ both a trained librarian and a bookmobile driver-librarian,  and to buy a bookmobile which would extend free book service to every  corner of Johnston County. These three goals were reached the first  year without interfering with the already existing library units in Ben­son,  Clayton, Kenly, Selma and Smithfield.  Highlights in the second year were: mapping out and developing  bookmobile routes, library publicity, weeding out and building book col­lections,  strengthening older branch libraries and establishing new -ones,  making local appropriations replace WPA financial support which was  withdrawn March 1, 1943, having the ,county library incorporated, initi­ating  library service to Negroes, collecting books for the Victory Book  Campaign, sponsoring county-wide story hours and va,cation reading  club programs for the children during the sum.mer, and entering a float  in the Farmers' Day parade.  Emphasis the third year has been pl,aced upon library cooperation  with teachers, book clubs, study groups, civic clubs, Home Demonstra­tion  reading clubs, county health department in typhoid clinics and with  Boy and Girl Scouts in an ,effort to make reading and study m,aterial  available and convenient. A Post War Library Planning Committee  with' each of the seventeen townships in the county represented has  been org,anized this year for the purpOSe of extending library support  and interest and of laying the foundation for expanded library service  in the future.  Increased financial support during these past three years has made  steady growth possible. The County appropriation for the library in  1941 was $3,000, in 1942 was $3,200, in 1943 was $3,750 and for the cur­rent  year is $5,000. Local and State appropriations have also increased  some. In spite of this growth, the income per capita for libraries in  Johnston County is still only $.16 whereas the state average is $.21,  national average is $.42 and American Library Association standard is  $2.00.  )",2008-08,,Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,75B253994662460423D105C1B2E9101BE8CBEDBC; SHA-1,,,,2011-08-10,2011-08-10,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1844,1844,1843.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1843.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C.  Ladies and 'Gentlemen:  As librarian, I have the honor to submit  herewith the annual report and revie\v of the  growth and activities of the Public Libr'ary  for the year of 1928~  As this is my fifth accounting to you of this  trust which I administer at your direction and  in your name I ,vish to o:utline briefly what has  been accomplished during these five years and  what is needed for the sixth year. During th~  time the work has taken on new character .  power both as to extent of city and co  territory covered by book distribution andl  kind of service rendered to the community as  a ,vhole. In our efforts, four objectives have  been emphasized and \vill be discussed here:  i.e., (1) more and better books· (2) a larger  and better qualified library personnel; (3)  more intensive and specific extension of library  facilities; (4) lastly, the enlargement of library  building accommodations to meet the demands  of extended use.  Books  The report of January 1, 1924 shows that  the library contained 12,464 volumes to serve  a population of 38,000 (1920 census), or roughly  speaking one book for each three persons.

One other new extension service was begun  by the library in 1928. Late in the autumn  of last year Watts Hill called at this office  and asked if the library could arrange in any  way to let hospital patients have books. The  librarian was delighted to give this service and  the necessary arrangements were made at once,  so that all this year on Friday of each week a  member of the staff with a goodly supply of  books has visited Watts Hospital, and wheeling  her books frOIn ward to ward and room to  room, has distributed 2,573 books to patients,  nurses, and hospital officials.  Although no department of the library has  shown such phenonlenal progress as the county  .extension, there has been a normal and satis­factory  growth in all lines of its activities ex­cept  in children's work. The only measuring  stick which can be readily applied is that of  circulation, and. annual statistics show a steady  decrease since 1924 in the number of children's  books borrowed from the Main library. 1924  saw a Juvenile circulation of 25,000 (in round  numbers); in 1925 it was 23,000, in 1926,22,000;  in 1927, 21,000; and in 1928, 19,824..

A children's librarian has it in her power to  direct this force by herself loving books, and  otr.er fine things, so much that they radiate  from her.

This year marks the fifth complete year of a new and revitalized library service  in \Vinston- Salem and Forsyth County'. These new improved and enlarged library  services have come to the citizens of this community because of a greater interest  of a few citizens in improving the cultural life of the community. \!ithin this five  year period"" two modern, functional library buildings have been built of which every­one  is justly proud.' These two buildings are more than stone, bricks, and mortar.  They are institutions that have a very definite purpose; with their equipment and  contents of library materials, and their personnel, they are equipped to assist you in  having a more profitable and e'njoyable life.  The public's response to the services now rendered in these new library buildings  can be measured by the increased use being made of these facilities. \Ve show a net  increase of approximately 7, 500 registered borrowers for the library sy'stem during  this five year period, which gives us a total of about 28, 000 registered borrowers.  There are some new services which are offered that should be mentioned here.  Others will be illustrated and dealt with more fully. Our new facilities provide  specific areas in both buildings for art exhibits. We have in the past had many out­standing  art exhibits displayed in these galleries. We try each year t&lt;;&gt; bring several  interesting exhibitions here. We have some meeting rooms which are available to  community groups. These rooms may be used by educational, literary, cultural, or  scientific groups.  The public library has instituted new services and increased other services  vvithin the past five years, and it will continue to improve, increase, and render new  services within the limits of its staff and budget. vVe feel that there is a great need  for the consideration of the expansion of library services through additional branches,  both within the city and also in the outlying larger communities in the county. It has  been proven in other cities that branches are a must if complete library service is to  be given to all. Many persons find it inconvenient or impossible to come to the main  library in the center of the city, whereas they could visit a community library once  or twice a week if it were located in a community or shopping center where they  ordinarily go.",2008-08,,Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,B46EAD4D510DB22A8479E5910F0A37E9AB1136F0; SHA-1,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1892,1892,1891.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1891.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the period through 1956 the library added an average of approximately  15, 000 volumes of bool{s each year. The greater portion of these additions were  purchases. Less than 50/0 of the additions were gifts. During the period as in­dicated  we were a.pending an accumulated library bool\. fund which had been donated  by the citizens of this community. \Xfe spent during that time about $35, 000 per  year for books. During the year 1957/58 our additions were reduced to 11,394  volumes. This drop from previous years was due to the fact that our book budget  was reduced since the library book fund had been spent. The library's book budget  as an appropriated item for 1957 /58 was $'25 ~ 000. It is felt that our additions  each year should be a minimum of 15, 000 volumes in order to add additional  copies of titles that are in great demand. The reduction in our book budget per­mits  us to do very little duplicating of copies.

There are a number of reasons why the reference and  information questions have so greatly increased. Perhaps the nt~rl1ber one reason,  would be more adequate facilities. We now have six or eight times the reading  room space that we had previously. Our reference co llection of handbooks, encyclo­pedias,  and reference books has been more than doubled. We have more than doubled  our collection of current periodicals, and many periodicals have been bound and are  more readily available for reference use. The library now subscribes to the  majority of non-scientific indexing services which makes our periodicals more  available to the public. Since 1955 this library has been a Federal Depository for  government publications. These publications are a source of much information that  was previously not available. Our .pamphlet and clippings file has been greatly en­larged,  and these items are a valuable source of quick information.  In addition to our own resources, this library, through two cooperative programs,  has access to materials in the larger public libraries and the college and university  libraries of the state.  The public libraries of North Carolina have developed special collections of  non-fiction materials"" and these materials are available on interlibrary loan with  the assistance of the North Carolina State Library. There has recently been in­augurated  a service at Chapel Hill known as the Inter-library Center. Thiii center  has in its union catalog a card for the majority of books in all of the libraries of  this state. Information can now be obtained from this center as to the location of a  book within the state. It is expected that this center and many of the libraries will be  connected by some type of telecommunication method.

The Extension  Department and the East vVinston Branch circulated 92,983 volumes. The total in­crea:.  3e in circulation of the entire system over the five year period from 1953 to 1958  has l)een approximately 930/0. The average increase per year has been about 180/0.  The figures below show our circulation breakdown by groups rather tl1an by  agencies.  Total book circulation is the best means that we have of evaluating the library's  ser~lice to the community. (We do keep records of other services and tl1eir use  'Nhich help us to get an overall picture of the use of the library. )  A.s pointed out in another area of this· report, we feel that there is a great need  for 2..dditional branches in our system. A comparison of circulation of book..... from  our Jnain library with the circulation in the main library at Charlotte shows that  these two libraries circulated approximately the same number of bool{s; ho,vever I \ the  Charlotte system circulated more than 2-1 /2 times the number circulated by the  entire system here, the difference being accounted for by the fact that Cha.rlutte has  ten branches in addition to its two bookmobiles. The Charlotte system had three  branches which circulated over 75,000 volumes each. These figures sh.ov.i"" that  borroy/ers utilize the neighborhood lending services to a greater degree thaD. they do  the main library.  The .public library last year circulated 2-1 /4 books per capita; in other words,  ever~., man"" woman, and child in the county read the equivalent of over two books  fro:iTI the public library.

Percentage wise the circulation of childrenI s books has shown a slightly smaller  increase than has the adult collection. There may be a few reasons for this.;  however J we shall not analyze these reasons.  The children's department has for several years conducted a summer reading  .program. This program stimulates more and better reading among the children.  At the end of the summer in 1957 the department had a party for the children, and I  125 children were awarded certificates for having completed the required reading.  The children's department participated in the National Book Week celebration  by showing some Picture Book Parade films. The department had some of the out­standing  juvenile books of 1957 reviewed by children for Book Week. These reviews  were published in the Sunday edition of the Journal and Sentinel.  VIe have had several outstanding exhibits in the display case in the Children's  Room, including sea shells, mountain crafts, old: fashioned dolls, old and rare  books, unusual Easter eggs at Easter time, and an attractive assortment of  Japanese articles.  The library has added to its collection specifically for the Children's Department  several sets of audio-visual materials (filmstrip with records). These are used  principally for the Story Hour programs.  The library purchased from a s.pecial fund an oil painting ""Tugboat"" by Claude  tIowell, and this is hanging in the Children's Room.  The children's librarian gave talks in a number of the schools regarding the  services rendered by the public library. Talks were also given by the childrenr s  librarian to P. T. A. grou.ps as to how the library serves the schools of Winston­Salem  and Forsyth County.",2008-08,,Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,B46EAD4D510DB22A8479E5910F0A37E9AB1136F0; SHA-1,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1896,1896,1895.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1895.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to that time the library had only a small juvenile  record collection.  This service includes films and phono- records, and the demands for this service  have increased greatly since it was begun. The phono- record collection has grown  from a few juvenile reco~ds to about 2,800 discs; however, a number of these are  the 78 rpm's which rarely circulate. The adult collection-includes classical and  semi-classical recordings. There' are some recordings of folksongs, music from  popular plays, and some recorded speeches. The collection does not include any  language study records at the present. Phdnorecords may be borrowed by any adult  permanent card holder.  The adult film program began actually a short time before we moved to the new  main library building. This came about as the result of the inauguration of a  cooperative film project by the North Carolina State Library, with ten cooperating  libraries. The State' Library supplied the funds with which to purchase a number  of films, and these films were distributed on a scheduled plan to all participating  libraries .  Over the five year .period the library has acquired a number of films of its own,  until we have about 60 films in our own collection. vVe can also draw upon the  State Library project collection which has been enlarged to now number a few hun­dred  films. During the past year the library loaned about 100 films per month,  and they were viewed by about 3,000 persons per month.  The j\udio- Visual section is able to give assistance to patrons in the use of film.  We have many sources for locating free and inexpensive films, and can render  assistance in .program planning in the uSe of film .",2008-08,,Epson Expression 10000XL,300 dpi,24,,B46EAD4D510DB22A8479E5910F0A37E9AB1136F0; SHA-1,,,,2011-08-09,2011-08-09,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/1897,1897,1896.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/1896.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The branch, like the main library,  has enlarged and improved facilities, and is in a position to render pr~ctical1.y  all of the services rendered by the main library. The branch library has a well­chosen  collection of phono- records for use only in the library. The audio-visual  service (the lending of films and phono- records) in the main library is available  to every resident of the community.  The branch library has made every effort to take library service to the citizens  of the community through various planned programs. There have been a number of  adult activities designed to give guidance to persons in many areas, and the guidance  programs have included selected and well-chosen books to supplement one's thinking.  Many groups within the community and groups from outside the community as  well have availed themselves of the services of the librarians. Many of these groups  have visited the library and have been briefly instructed in the use of some of the  tools and sources of information.  The branch librarians have cooperated \vith many community groups such as  the YMCA, the Y\VCA, the Girl Scouts, and others, in assisting them in the selection  of suitable materials for their programs.  Much attention has been given to a young adult program, in helping these persons  solve some of their everyday problems. This activity is under the direct supervision  of one of the librarians J with periodic programs arranged so that the participants may  discuss some of their problems, and at the same time gain knowledge from specialists  in certain fields in which they are interested. The activity of this group has been  reflected in greater use of the books in the Young Adult section .  The Children's Department has conducted its usual story hours and Reading Club  activity. There has been a decided increase in the use of this department which shows  in our statistical record, but most of all is the interest of the parents who come with  their children. These parents are interested in helping their children and seeing  that they are helped in securIng the books that serve their individual needs best.  : :' ~  "", .' : ~ '\ "".': : .,. ,  ... , "" , : !

Our one bookmobile, which has a capacity of about 1, 500 books, mal&lt;es a  total of slightly over 100 stops in the entire county, about 25 of these within the city  limits of Winston- Salem. The bookmobile visits each stop every three wee!&lt;s.  The library placed its yvalk-in bookmobile in operation in 1954; prior to that time  a 1 /2 ton panel truc}&lt;- bool&lt;mobile with a capacity of about 500 books was used. We  have had about a 200/0 increase in circulation of books since 1954.  '.  , ':: ; "" .. :  The bookmobile stops should be made at least every two weeks instead of the  present schedule of three weel&lt;s. Vie are trying to spread the service so that a  maximum number of persons may be served, and in so doing we are spreading the  service so thin that its effectiveness in some areas is doubtful.  The Extension Department operates a sub-branch in the Vienna Fire Station,  which is staffed by volunteer help. During tIle early spring of 1958 a sub-branch  was opened in Kernersville. The library cooperated with the vVoman rs Club ·of  ~ernersville, and with the assistance of other organizations the former town hall  was renovated and converted into a town library. The library in the beginning was  staffed by volunteers, and during the summer some of the civic organizations  employed a high school stude'nt to keep the library open three afternoons a week.  .  The Extension librarian has cooperated with P .. T. A. groups in the preparation  of reading lists.  The Extension Department has its own collection of books, which1are kept sepa­rate  from the Main Library collection. The Extension Department may borrow  books from the main collection for its borrowers; however, if a book is in sufficient  demand on the bookmobile, we suggest that a copy or copies be added to their collec­tion.  • _ t ~. r~ ..'  .: . \··t ~ ',: 'l I.. .

The  Director of the Arts Council has in the past  been primarily responsible for selecting  all of the exhibits for the main library  and the branch, and in many instances he  has assumed ihe responsibility of making  contractual ~rrangements. It is recommended  that the Director of the library be made a  member of the committee selecting exhibits,  since a new Arts Council Director will soon  be emp!oyed. The library is responsible for  $11 exhibits and is responsible for payment  Qf""~ll fees; therefore,a representative  should know what arrangements are being  made.  EXTENSION SERVICES  This department gives service to the  rural areas and some of the outlying areas  within the City through its bookmobile.  The circulation of this department dropped  considerably this year over the previous  year. The r~ason for this decrease was  the fact that we had to give service for  more than six""months from the old panel  truck which we had previously used as a  bookmobile. Our large bookmobile was  wrecked at the beginning of the year and  it took us more than seven months to replace  this unit. The Extension Department es­tablished  two sub-branches in the county,  one located in a community f~re station  and the other in a community houae. Due  to the annexation of approximately 12  square miles of territory into the City  in January 1957, the population of Winston­Salem  has now increased to more than  100,000.

The public used the old building on North Cherry Street until March 7,  and usual service was given until that time.· The main library was  closed for a period of almost three weeks, while preparations were  being made to move the book collection to the new quarters on West  Fifth Street, and during the actual moving.  During the period of occupancy of the old building, every effort  was made to continue the usual service to the public; however, much  effort was concentrated upon the selection of books, and the placing  of orders for books, rather than the processing and cataloging of  books. During the latter period in the old building, only the most  essential books were catalogued and made available. During that time,  the collection was examined and weeded of old, and worn material. Our  records show that 5,953 volumes were withdrawn from the main library.  This figure does not account for all that were withdrawn, because the  official cards for all that had been withdrawn were not recorded by  July 1. These old and worn copies of books were given to the public  ,  after institutions and agencies had their choice of selection. During  the process of moving the staff was divided into teams or groups.  Some of these groups were responsible for the packing and proper marking  of the boxes. The actual moving was done by Yarborough Transfer Co.  under a contract. However, the movers did not pack or unpack any of  the books. Part of the staff was stationed in the new building to re-ceive  the boxes of books. They were unpacked and placed on the shelves  by these persons. The actual moving required 8 days. However, a longer  period of time waS required to get all of the books and other materials  on the shelves.

During the  time that the old library was closed, the Horton Branch gave library  service to everyone.  New Quarters  Mention was made in the previous year's report of new quarters and  how they were taking shape to become a reality. The construction of the  building was delayed some during the latter stages; however, it was  completed and given to the city on February 20, although after that  date, minor details had to be finished. There were minor delays in  the installation of equipment. The library decorating committee with  Mr. Dan Cooper of Dan Cooper, Inc., worked very hard and diligently  and the results of their hard 'work are very pleasing to view. It was  most difficult to judge the dates when we could accept the furniture  and equipment, and as a result of this uncertainty, much of the furni­ture  was delivered before we could adequately store it, and as a re­sult  of this, some items suffered slight damage. It may be well to  mention here the source of furniture and equipment.

The increased  reference collection in the form of new and additional reference books  and additional periodicals have greatly improved this collection. The  addition of new and increased reference materials has reflected in a  greater number of referenc·e questions. Since moving to the new building,  the number of reference questions has doubled. The greatly enlarged a·nd  improved facilities have also been responsible for more than a doubled  registration of borrowers of both adults and children.  Before we moved to our new building, the Junior League of Winston­Salem  agreed to select the Children's Department as their project.  This group has assisted in many ways in giving better and more complete  service to the children through this department. Members of the Junior  League have been responsible for the Children's Story Hour, on an en­larged  and improved scale. This activity is conducted three days per  week. The Junior League has also selected and purchased phonograph  records, and they expect to add film to the Children's Department. The  members of this group have assisted in many other ways such as select­ing  and mounting paintings ·for a picture collection, assisting with the  work of selecting and reviewing books for the Radio Council, and the  selection and purchasing of simple games for children.

It will be shown elsewhere the amount of  this fund which has been spent for books. The libiary has received  many gifts in the form of memorials to loved ones and friends.

The Mary Symington Book Club presented  a 16"" globe of the world to the library in memory of Mrs. Katharine  Boring Rondthaler. This globe is mounted on a beautiful light wood  frame. During the year, a painting with the title ""Norristown"", by  Walter Stuempfig was purchased through the Lucy Hanes Chatham fund,  and hangs on the wall in the reading room. We have received gift books  from many citizens too numerous to mention. We are grateful to all of  these friends who have contributed money and books.  Activities of the Library  The usual questions have come to the Reference and Information  Desk. However, community trends and activities have been reflected 1n  many of the inquiries for information. The art exhibits and the gifts  of art objects have renewed and aroused greater interest in the fine  arts. Inquiries about the arts have more than tripled. We have had  an increased number of requests for house plans, home decorating and  home planninge Business men and industrial firms have made, greater use  of the collection, these ~equests have mUltiplied four~fold. This past  year has been a great year for travel jUdging from the number of patrons  requesting information concerning places to go and things to do.

The child is given a large card which looks like a certificate  with the name of the library upon it. There is a black and white sketch  of a library building, with white blocks. For each book completed, a  r8d brick is pasted on a white block until 59 books have been read--  the number of white blocks. The completed certificate is a document  of accomplishment which the child will keep and treasure, since th9  certificate has upon it the child's name, school and date of program.  The library participated in the American Heritage Program sponsored  by the American Library Association. ThG participation in this program  consisted of a series of programs where the basic principles of American  Heritage were discussed by individuals, led by a group leader and a  discussion panel. The library also sponsored the Vlorld Politics Group  supported by the American Foundation for Political Education, an agency  of the Ford Foundation, this group met weekly in the library during  the latter months of the year.  The Horton Branch Library was awarded a medal for its activity in  the American Heritage Program in 1951-52 by the Freedom Foundation.  The award was based on slides and film strip which was made of this  American Heritage group. The Horton Branch Library was also awarded  the John Cotton Dana publicity award, which was a special award for  its work with community groups. This award was jointly presented by  the H. W.

The past year was a time of progress  and growth for the Catawba .County Library,  both in extension of services and in the  acquisition of needed equipment. The city  and county governments had given encourage­ment  by granting additional revenue. The  governing bodies, after attending 'a meeting  in the Library, bec:ame convinced that  shelving, stacks and office equipment was  sorely needed, and appropriated additional  funds for this purpose.

The governor asked North  Carolimans to rededicate  themselves ''to the preserva­tion  of that great heritage  which ... we have come to  recognize 35 a moving force in  the progress of our state.""  Tar Heels do not worship the  past nor live in it, Scott said,  but (we) ""derive strength and  direction for the future by  knowing about our successes  and failures ....  ""Without a knowledge of our  history, we cannot know where  we are or where we need to  go.""  Dignitaries  Many North Carolina and  out-of-state dignitaries at·  tended the dedication. The  building, on Jones street here,  was completed earlier this  year.  Among them were former  Governors Luther Hodges and  Dan Moore. Governor Scott  pointed out that ""the move­ment  for a home for our  culture was given en·  couragement"" during Hodges'  administration, that funds  were allocated for the building  under Governor Terry San­ford,  and that the bulk of can·  struction was done u n d c r  Governor Moore.  The governor said, ""A (ine  building would contribute little  were it not for the pro­grams  and functions of the two  agencies housed in it."" He  reviewed some past ac·  complishments of the Depart.  ment of Archives and History  and the State Library and  their leaders.  Other participants in the  ceremony included Dr. H. G.

So in 1967, shortly after moving  to Raleigh where he is associate  professor of philosophy at North  Carolina State University, Dr.  Resan organized a group of local  indIviduals interested in making  recordings for the North Carolina­South  Carolina Library for the  Blind and Physically Han ­dicapped.  His is not the only such group in  the state. Friends of the Carteret  County Library in Morehead  recently recruited a smiliar group.  And the Blue Ridge BrailJers up in  Asheville sponsor a well-trained  corps of volunteers to produce  books in braille.  They fill an important function.  Large Expenses  To produce a talking book costs  the Library of Cong r ess an  average of $3 ,300 for an edition of  700 copies. A braille book will run  about $1 ,000 for an edition of 70. As  a result, their titles are necesscrri-  Iy limited to those which would in­terest  a gene r a l na ti ona l  readership.  But what about less standard  works? Books by regional authors  on r egional subj ects? Inglis  Fletcher's books, for instance, are  in great demand in this area. Or a  specialized sou rce book needed by  a blind student?  Here's where the volun teers  come in.  The Ra leigh and Morehead  groups function similarly. Each  group records assigned books on  tape players loaned by the Raleigh  Library. The Library's sta ff then  re-records onto a master and  makes as many copies as it needs.  ""We do a lot of fiction,"" Dr.  Regan observes, "" lesser works of  Herman Melville, for , instance.  And we've just comple ted a  biography of Madame Curie.""  Dr. Regan draws his volunteers  for the most part from students  and fac ulty a t Sta te. ""Our  numbers will vary from five or six  to as many as 30, depending on the  time of year. But wi th each  volunteer reading an hour a day  we can usually do a book a week.""  He said he would be happy to have  potential volunteers call him at his  NCSU office for information about  the program.  At first the group headquartered  at the University's library but  when it expanded they lost their  space. They now use one of the  classrooms at West Raleigh  Presbyterian Church across from  the college.  "" It ' s been a happy  arrangement/' Dr. Regan main­tains.  "" The only problem comes  with warm weather and open win·  dows. The noises of children on the  playground aren' t the best  background for , say, Madame  Bovary.""  Each member of the Morehead  group reads an entire book, kf!ep­ing  both book and tape player at  home for however many weeks he  may need it. ""It slows us down,""  admits John Reintjes, the marine  biologist who heads the group,  ""but this way one book is recorded  by a single voice.""  The number of his readers  varies also. ""It's always more  work than you think it's going to  be. But you read things you might  , nE!ver read otherwise, and if you  ... Continued on Page 7'  - Y SARA VETTE TROTTER  Not long ago Mrs. Miriam Leith, director  of the North Carolina-South Carolina  Library for the Blind and Physically Han­dicapped  in Raleigh, received the following  post card from a Wilmington resident:  ""My deepest appreciation for your prompt  action in getting the talking books to me.  They are the bright light at the end of a dark  tunnel. ""  , This woman, an elderly cataract patient,  had just become a patron of the most unique  library in the state.  No soft-spoken receptionist greets you  from behind a panelled desk. No students  lounge at long tables, textbooks piled  eyebrow high. No comfortable armchairs in­vite  browsing.  Instead, rows of cardboard containers lin­ed  metal bookshelves and unopened boxes  clutter the hallways of a warehouse-like  structure hidden at the end of a dead end  street.  Throughout the day, stacks of these con­tainers  are piled onto a conveyor belt which  carry them to the basement. From there  Soravette Trotter is Q  Rocky Mount free-lance ';'riter.  Dr. Thomas Regon, director  of the volunteer program  helps prepare a new ""talking  book.""  they are ro led on porta61e s6elVeSUiroug6  bare corridors to the mail room where they  are dumped by the hundreds into canvas  sacks, ready to be sent out across the two  Carolinas.  It is a drab building, musty and uninviting.  But to 11,000 blind or physically handicapped  individuals in North and South Carolina, the  library it houses is indeed the bright ligHt at  the end of a dark tunnel.  The story begins back in 1931 with the  passage of the national Pratt-8moot Act  which authorized the federal government to  coordinate and expand library services for  the blind on a national and regional basis.  The Library of Congress, the act stated,  would produce and make available to  regional libraries books and magazines in  braille for the adult legally blind.  As it turned out, the Act barely scratched  the surface.  First of all, only about 5% of the blind read  braille. For example, the recently blinded  older person , like the woman from  Wilmington, cannot develop the necessary  sensitivity of touch. That's an ability which  for the average person must be learned ~r­Iy  in life.  Difficulty Reading '.:  fn addition, there are many people,  children included, who cannot mee.t . the  rather rigid criteria for "" legally"" blind but  who still have difficulty reading the printed  word. Add to these the paralyzed, amputees,  those afflicted with cerebral palsy. None can  hold a book .  . AS. these limitations became apparent, the  servIce expanded.  It soon included talking books (bqok,&lt;; or  magazines.recorded on long-playing &lt;~rds  by profeSSIOnal readers), plus machines on  which to play them. Still later came bQOks on  open-reel and cassette tape. In 1952 the law  was amended to allow an extensive  children's program. Finally, in 1966 a new  law made the library service available • ..'free  of charge, to all persons unable ~ for  whatever physical limitation, to read- con­ventional  printed material.  The North Carolina-South Carolina  Library for the Blind and Physically . Han­dicapped,  as it is now known, was originally  established by the Legislature in 1958 as one  of the network of regional libraries. Follow­ing  the recent re-organization it became  part of the Special Services Division of the  State Library, under the overall jurisdiction  of the Department of Art, Culture and  History. By contract with the state of South  Carolina, the Library serves that state as  well.  Only Need Certificate  To qualify for its services a handicapped  person needs only a certificate of eligibility  from a competent authority : phYSician,  nurse, therapist, librarian. For the legally  blind, certification is established through  the State Commission for the BHnd.  ""As soon as certification is established,  we put the person's name on file and begin  Continued on Page ,.",,,,,,,,,,,2012-05-17,2012-05-17,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/2059,2059,2058.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/2058.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Send Several Books  ""We send him several books,  along with a talking book  machine if he is physically  handicapped. The legally blind  re ceive their mac hi nes  through the Blind Commission.  When he returns a group of  books, we send back an equal  number of new ones that same  day . He may keep the  machine, of course, for as long  as he remains a Lib rary  patron.""  sellers are the most popular:  The New Centurions, Eleanor  and Franklin, Captains and  The Kings_ Some readers will  go through four or five  whodunits in a week. Travel  books are popular too, and  books on the Carolinas. And  a nything of a religio us  nature.""  Difficult to Mail  Braille books a re routed  through a separate depart·  ment. These are bulky and dif­ficult  to mail. One page of  braille measures approximate­ly  lOxll inches. A single  volume may be eight inches  thick, with the average book  taking several volumes. Gone  . With The Wind - a.perennial  Books to the Blind  favorite - uses Il volumes.  But the Library has well  over l ,OCKl ti tles in braille.  These include a la rge selection  of children's books, many of  which incorporate ext r a  features designed to increase  sensory awareness.  A blind child can learn the  contours of Lucy and Snoopy,  for instance, by running his  fi ngers over the raised il­lustrations  of Love Is Walking  Hand In Hand. The Night  Before Christmas also has  raised illustrations, as well as  actual tiny stockings, caps and  toy mice for the child to han·  die. The Golden Book series is  produced with a transparent  sheet of braille placed over the  ink print so that a sighted  parent can read to the child.  Many Thousand Volumes  Each day the Library's staff  r eceives and sends out as  many as a thousand volumes of  talking books and tapes and 75  volumes of braille. ""We don't  count our mail by the price but  by the pound,"" Mrs. Leith  muses.  But unlike most lib raries.  this one likes to lose patrons.  Occasionally it happens.  Anot her post card came  through the mail recently: ""I  am re turning my ta lking book  machine as I have had my eye  operation and no longer need  the services of your library.""  One person had come at last  to the end of his dark tunnel.  On his application each sub­scriber  states his age, educa­tion  and general reading in­terest  and this becomes a han­dy  reference for the staff in  selecting books. "" It's always  nice when a reader makes a  specific request,"" Mrs . Leith  observes, "" but most leave the  choice up to us. And in time we  get to know an individual's,  preferences pretty well.  Work For Volunteers  Over 6,000 Tilles  ""We have over 6,OCKl titles in  talking books, cassette and  reel tapes,"" she continues,  ""covering whatever subjects  you 'd find in any public  library. No textbooks, though.  ""Our readers run the gamut  of age, sex and educational  level and their tastes vary ac·  cordingly. As always, best-  Continued from Page 1  enjoy it you don·t mind giving.  the time.""  Braille"" Diffe rent  Braillers are in a different  category. Learning to braille  takes hours of training, and  each volunteer must meet  standards of skill set by the  Library of Congress. There are  about 16-18 volunteer braillers  throughout the state, but the  largest number work through  the Blue Ridge Brailters in  Asheville.  Completed manuscripts are  sent to the Raleigh Library  where they are proofread by a  parttime blind employe. They  are then copied and bound,  ready for mailing.  "" The work of a ll these  volunteers goes a long way  toward helping us answer the  individual needs of our readers  in this area,"" maintains Mrs.  Miriam Leith, the Library's  director.  ""One day we hope to have  the staff to better coord inate  their activities and expand the  areas in which they work -  record ing highlights from dai·  ly newspapers, perhaps, and  increasing the number of  regional magazines we can  make available.""  Meanwhile, th is small group  of men and women give of  their time and energies in what  can only be tenned a labor of  love.  -SARAVE'ITE TROTTER",,,,,,,,,,,2012-05-17,2012-05-17,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll36/id/2060,2060,2059.pdfpage,,/p249901coll36/image/2059.pdfpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
