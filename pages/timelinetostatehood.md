## Early Washington Maps: Timeline to Statehood

Early Washington Maps: A Digital Collection is the product of a partnership
between the University of Washington Libraries Map Collections and Washington
State University's Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections. The maps of
this collection have been drawn solely from the collections of these two
institutions and are widely varied, ranging from large-scale geographical maps
to small hand-drawn sketches of settlements. In the time period spanned by this
project, the Pacific   Northwest went from being considered "parts as yet
unknown" to being the   subject of literally thousands of maps concerned with
geography, transportation,   climate, population, cultures, politics, tourism,
and other   topics.</p>

This timeline presents a small portion of those maps in a historical
perspective. The maps chosen are not necessarily from the noted date, but are
instead picked to represent the events of that date. In keeping with the wide
spectrum of maps to choose from, some of the maps will provide a general
overview of the event in question, while some will be relevant only to one
small example of the item. For further maps related to a given event or date,
please search the database using either the event or date as keywords.
