# About CollectionBuilder

This is a demonstration site built using [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm), a skin driven by metadata exported from the [Psychiana Digital Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/psychiana/) from the [University of Idaho Library](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/).

CollectionBuilder is a lightweight, flexible tool for creating digital collection websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology. 
Using three primary components—a spreadsheet of metadata, a directory of assets, and a configuration file—CollectionBuilder gives information professionals and digital scholarship practitioners agency in building and customizing digital collection websites for free. 

CollectionBuilder is designed and maintained by librarians at the University of Idaho according to the [Lib-STATIC](https://lib-static.github.io/) approach, a methodology committed to leveraging static-web technologies and librarians' specialized skills in metadata and classification to create engaging web publications.
