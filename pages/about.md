## About the Collection Builder CDM Skin

This demo collection features items from the University of Idaho Library's [Psychiana Digital Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/psychiana/), and is built using [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm).

CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm is a template for creating digital collection exhibits on top of existing CONTENTdm repositories. 
The demo collection features images, document pdfs, audio, and YouTube video items to demonstrate the range of possibilities using the CollectionBuilder visualizations.

Psychiana was a "mail order" religion popular in the 1930s and 40s.
