### About the {{site.title}}

Are maps "drawings to represent everything truly", or are they mere figments of imagination−a larger, fictitious reality we accept as place−a " conspiracy of cartographers"? What can a map, or series of maps sorted in time, show us? What, beyond the locations of landforms, places and peoples, do maps tell us about the past? Maps, be they inaccurate musings or mathematical / astrological renderings, answer many questions. They explain our past and how people viewed their world, or new worlds; what people saw their world becoming and even what unknown lands may potentially possess. In a sense, maps are more about humans than of places. By studying these past maps we find−hidden within colorful cartouches, precise boundaries and skillful gradations by an artists' hand−the assumptions placed on the land as observed by their authors. These attempts document the hopes behind the lands first explored, fervently irrigated and farmed, scarred in battle, mined, evangelized…coveted.

Since the discovery of the Pacific Northwest Coast and the sea explorations by both Spain and Great Britain, the region has been sought for countless, sometimes elusive, dreams: Spain's lust for lost cities of gold, Britain's hunger for new fur trade markets and hunting grounds, America's love affair with the Jeffersonian ideal of the quintessential, gentleman farmer. All of these countries, including France, shared the apocryphal delusion that somewhere, perhaps within the mighty waters of the Columbia River system, lay the route of the fabled Northwest Passage−sea route from the Atlantic Ocean to East Asia for trade desired since the days before Columbus. However, no matter what the catalyst, the goal remained ever the same−the ownership of the Pacific Northwest. 

Early Washington Maps: A Digital Collection, a collaboration between Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections and the University of Washington Libraries, contains the vision which numerous such authors held for the Pacific Northwest. Spanning three hundred years, Early Washington Maps: A Digital Collection includes maps of both sea and land faring explorers−from David Thompson, the successful navigator of the Columbia River, to the exploits of William Clark and Merriwether Lewis. It documents the struggle between Britain and America for the ownership of the region, and the further development of one of the last frontiers on the continent. Some of the digital collection's maps delineate the boundaries under dispute within the years 1818 and 1846, culminating in a peaceful compromise and the decision of the 49th parallel as the northern border of the United States. The digital collection also shows the efforts of the U.S. government to survey the land, for both federal and private use, under the watchful, trained eye of the General Land Office and the Corps of Topographical Engineers.

Finally, this database showcases the hopes placed on the land of not only the country, but of individual citizens as well, with maps platting out new towns, railroad tracks, postal roads, and Indian Reservations. This digital collection, therefore, not only documents the physical boundaries of the Pacific Northwest, but also the people themselves−and their tenacious efforts to control it, tame it, and claim it for their own. For this reason maps and the mapmakers behind these renderings−publishers like Samuel Augustus Mitchell and Alvin J. Johnson, or publishing houses such as Rand McNally−carried the dreams to a greater audience, enticed them to join in the vision, and, most importantly, showed them the way.
