### About the {{site.title}}

CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm is a template for creating digital collection exhibits on top of existing CONTENTdm repositories. 
This demonstration site features materials from the [Frank B. Robinson Papers](http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv97133/op=fstyle.aspx?t=k&q=psychiana) documenting Psychiana, a religion popular in the 1930s and 40s.
Visit the full [Psychiana Digital Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/psychiana/), also built with a version of CollectionBuilder, to learn more.

This collection features images, document pdfs, audio, and YouTube video items to demonstrate the range of possibilities using the CollectionBuilder visualizations.
